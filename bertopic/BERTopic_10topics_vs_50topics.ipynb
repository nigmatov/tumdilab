       "'Signalling Evangelical voters’ importance to 2020 campaign, five top Trump officials spoke at the CUFI summitIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and no less than five top US officials addressed the annual Christians United for Israel (CUFI) confab in Washington D.C. as the largest grassroots pro-Israel conference in America kicked off Monday.A common theme running through the evening’s heavyweight speeches: soaring tensions with Iran and the Islamic Republic’s nuclear capabilities.Netanyahu kicked off the evening, appearing via satellite link the 14th Annual CUFI Summit, an event which draws thousands of pro-Israel Evangelical Christians from across the United States each year.The Israeli leader dedicated a portion of his remarks to tensions with Iran, slamming the “terrible” 2015 nuclear deal with world powers which he claimed had paved the way for Tehran to develop a nuclear bomb.Signalling Evangelical voters’ importance to President Donald Trump’s 2020 re-election campaign, no fewer than five senior administration officials addressed the event.Vice President Mike Pence and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo (both Evangelical Christians themselves) addressed the confab on Monday, along with Trump’s national security adviser John Bolton, Special Mideast envoy Jason Greenblatt and US Ambassador to Israel David Friedman.Though CUFI describes itself as a bipartisan organization, no Democratic speakers are listed as participants.CUFI, which counts 4.3 million members from all 50 American states, touts itself as the largest pro-Israel grassroots organization which “strive[s] to act as a defensive shield against anti-Israel lies, boycotts, false theology, and political threats that seek to de-legitimize Israel’s existence and weaken the close relationship between Israel and the United States.”The organization actively lobbies Congress on pro-Israel policies, and counts among its victories the passing of the Taylor Force Act, which penalizes the Palestinian Authority for paying pensions to terrorists.While seeking to distinguish itself from dispensationalism, which holds that the modern state of Israel has a central role in bringing about the second coming of Jesus Christ, CUFI is founded on biblical teachings that God will bless those who bless the Jews and curse those who curse the Jews, noting that Christian faith could not exist with Judaism.'"

       "'Companies facing recruitment ‘crisis’JERSEY firms are already ‘in crisis’ due to the difficulties they face attracting staff from abroad and further delays to the population policy could worsen matters, a business representative has warned.   Sign Up  Murray Norton Picture: ROB CURRIE. (25172510) During a Scrutiny hearing, Chamber of Commerce chief executive Murray Norton warned that Brexit, housing issues, the falling value of the pound and improved economies in countries from which Jersey sources labour were making recruitment from overseas more difficult.Senator Kristina Moore, who chairs the Corporate Services Scrutiny Panel, asked Mr Norton whether he was happy with the timetable of the Migration Policy Board, which has decided to produce the Island’s population policy by April next year – four years later than first planned.Mr Norton said that uncertainty over the policy was making matters worse in what was already a ‘perfect storm’ for business in terms of recruitment problems. ‘Businesses we have spoken to this week have said “we are in crisis, right now – if we are going to have to wait until 2021, we are going to be out of business by then, because we can’t find people now”,’ he said. ‘Yes, the long term is what we are looking at with this, but there is also a short term. And the short-term feedback that we are getting is that businesses are not getting the licences or permissions that they were because of the overbearing pressure of population. ‘Even if they can get licences, they are unable to attract people for a variety of reasons – including Brexit, housing, the drop in the value of the Euro and, at the same time, in the traditional places which we would have gone for workers, the migrants are staying at home because their economies are the fastest-growing economies in Europe. There are a lot of small reasons creating a perfect storm for businesses at the moment.’During a series of Scrutiny hearings with the Corporate Services Scrutiny Panel, concerns have been raised over the lack of diversity and representation on the Migration Policy Board, including its shortage of young members, or representatives of Jersey’s large Polish and Portuguese communities, which run many businesses. The board is made up of chairman Assistant Chief Minister Chris Taylor, Social Security Minister Judy Martin, Environment Minister John Young, Senator Sarah Ferguson, Deputy Rowland Huelin, Dr Michael Oliver, Mr Norton on behalf of the Chamber of Commerce and John Shenton of the Institute of Directors.'"

Exercise Northern Strike is a robust military readiness event hosted annually at Michigan National Guard facilities, which, in addition to Alpena CRTC, will include Camp Grayling Joint Maneuver Training Center, Grayling Aerial Gunnery Range, the Carmeuse Calcite Quarry in Rogers City, and the former site of K.I. Sawyer Air Force Base in the Upper Peninsula. With approximately 5,700 participating Soldiers, Airmen, Sailors, and Marines, Northern Strike is one of the largest reserve component exercises supported by the U.S. Department of Defense. Its mission is to maximize the full-spectrum combat readiness of National Guard units through realistic, cost-effective joint fires training in an adaptable environment, with an emphasis on cooperation between joint and coalition forces. “This year, Northern Strike brings the familiar energy and excitement of combined live fire training in the U.S. military,” said Col. John Miner, commander, Alpena CRTC. “DoD components and coalition partners will face some new and challenging training that only an exercise like Northern Strike can offer. This exercise is about synchronized and integrated training – our component players and NATO allies will be tested.” Alpena CRTC will be the focal point of air operations during the exercise. Fixed wing aircraft scheduled to participate include the A-10 Thunderbolt II, F-16C Fighting Falcon, C-130 Hercules, MQ-9 Reaper, KC-135 Stratotanker, E-8C Joint STARS, Civil Air Patrol (CAP) Cessna 182, B-1B, B-52H, and EA-18. Rotary aircraft will also fly, including the UH-60 Blackhawk, AH-1W Super Cobra, CH-47 Chinook, and the UH-1Y Venom/Super Huey. The Northern Strike live-fire exercise involves small arms, mortars, artillery, and aerial munitions at the Camp Grayling range complex, along with simulated-fire exercises at the Carmeuse Lime and Stone Calcite Quarry in Rogers City and other locations. Close air support is the primary air mission, with other secondary missions including air interdiction, airlift and airdrop, combat search and rescue, air-to-air refueling and intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance. Miner points out that this year, two new exercise facets being staged from Alpena CRTC include the launch and recovery of an MQ-9 Reaper, and invigorated emphasis on aeromedical evacuation proficiency. “MQ-9s have participated in the exercise before, but we’ve never launched, flown and recovered them from the CRTC – this brings another level to the complexity and effectiveness of this exercise,” said Miner. “Also important this year is the added layer brought by the medical community. The scope of training, from injury to full-on delivery for treatment, will test our medical resources and readiness in the context of a major live-fire exercise on a scale that’s never been seen before.” Northern Strike also presents a unique opportunity to showcase collaboration between the Michigan National Guard and NATO allies and partner nations, including Latvia. For 26 years, the Michigan National Guard has enjoyed a rich partnership with the National Armed Forces of Latvia under the National Guard Bureau’s State Partnership Program (SPP). Latvian personnel will work side-by-side with Michigan National Guard Soldiers and Airmen during air and ground combat capability drills at Alpena. Collaboration between Latvian military personnel and Airmen from Alpena CRTC has been particularly strong in the fields of fire protection, air traffic control and airfield management, public affairs, and Joint Terminal Attack Control (JTAC) – a capability that allows the direction of combat aircraft engaged in close air support and other air operations from a forward position. “Michigan’s partnership with the National Armed Forces of Latvia was the first formed under the SPP in 1993,” said Lt. Col. Brook Sweitzer, bilateral affairs officer for the Michigan National Guard. “Since then, the relationship has grown in size and scope over the decades, forging trust and ties beyond what anyone could have originally expected. Exercise Northern Strike is a key event in this partnership because it puts American and Latvian service members side-by-side in realistic military scenarios that test the skills, interoperability, and mutual experience they’ve built together over many years.” This is the eighth year that Alpena CRTC has been a host for Exercise Northern Strike. The influx of visiting units provides a perennial boost to the local economy, with an estimated $2 million in added revenue each year. Miner heartily acknowledges the role that local community support plays in making a large-scale event like Northern Strike a success. “Without community support, this training opportunity would not be possible,” he said. “We realize we can sometimes inconvenience the public, but the training our Airmen receive at Alpena saves lives and creates effective warfighters in an environment that would not be possible any other way.”LEAVE A COMMENTNEWS INFOThis work, U.S., multinational forces to train in Michigan during Northern Strike 19 , by 1st Lt.

       "\"Trump digs in amid row over congresswomen tweetsTrump digs in amid row over congresswomen tweetsDonald Trump has refused to apologise after saying four congresswomen should go back to the &ldquo;broken and crime infested&rdquo; countries they came from, ignoring the fact they are all American citizens and three were born in the US. Even as White House officials moved on Monday to defend his incendiary weekend tweets, the US president asked on Twitter when &ldquo;the Radical Left Congresswomen&rdquo; would &ldquo;apologize to our Country, the people of Israel and even to the Office of the President, for the foul language they have used, and the terrible things they have said&rdquo;.&ldquo;So many people are angry at them &amp; their horrible &amp; disgusting actions!&rdquo; he wrote.When will the Radical Left Congresswomen apologize to our Country, the people of Israel and even to the Office of the President, for the foul language they have used, and the terrible things they have said. So many people are angry at them &amp; their horrible &amp; disgusting actions!Mr Trump had starkly injected race into his criticism of liberal Democrats over the weekend, drawing searing condemnation from Democrats who labelled the remarks racist and breathtakingly divisive.Asked whether Mr Trump&rsquo;s comments were racist, Marc Short, chief of staff to vice president Mike Pence, told reporters Mr Trump had been responding to &ldquo;very specific&rdquo; comments made by Representative Ilhan Omar, who was born in Somalia, and not making a &ldquo;universal statement&rdquo;.But Mr Trump did not make that distinction in his Monday tweets. He cited &ldquo;Congresswomen&rdquo; &ndash; an almost-certain reference to a group of women known as &ldquo;the squad&rdquo; that includes Ms Omar and Representatives Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Ayanna Pressley and Rashida Tlaib.Rashida Tlaib, left, Ilhan Omar, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Ayanna Pressley (AP)&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think that the president&rsquo;s intent any way is racist,&rdquo; said Mr Short, repeatedly pointing to Mr Trump&rsquo;s decision to choose Elaine Chao, who was born outside the country, as his transportation secretary.&ldquo;The administration is welcoming of all nationalities into the United States,&rdquo; he said.Even as Mr Short spoke, Mr Trump continued to fan the flames, tweeting: &ldquo;If Democrats want to unite around the foul language &amp; racist hatred spewed from the mouths and actions of these very unpopular &amp; unrepresentative Congresswomen, it will be interesting to see how it plays out.&rdquo;And the president stuck to his script with further remarks on Monday, saying: &ldquo;If you hate our country&hellip; you can leave.&rdquo;&ldquo;If you&rsquo;re not happy in the US, if you&rsquo;re complaining all the time, you can leave, you can leave right now.&rdquo;Ms Omar ignited a bipartisan uproar in Washington several months ago when she suggested that members of Congress support Israel for money, while Ms Tlaib riled up a supportive crowd by calling the president a profanity and predicting that Mr Trump would be removed from office.Following a familiar script, Republicans remained largely silent after Mr Trump&rsquo;s Sunday morning broadsides that caused Democrats to set aside their internal rifts to rise up in a united chorus against the president.House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Mr Trump wants to &ldquo;make America white again&rdquo;. Ms Ocasio-Cortez, after jousting for days with Ms Pelosi, said Mr Trump &ldquo;can&rsquo;t conceive of an America that includes us&rdquo;.Mr. President, the country I &ldquo;come from,&rdquo; &amp; the country we all swear to, is the United States.But given how you&rsquo;ve destroyed our border with inhumane camps, all at a benefit to you &amp; the corps who profit off them, you are absolutely right about the corruption laid at your feet. https://t.co/HLKQCotR8T&ldquo;Mr. President, the country I &lsquo;come from,&rsquo; &amp; the country we all swear to, is the United States,&rdquo; she tweeted, adding that &ldquo;You rely on a frightened America for your plunder.&rdquo; Ms Omar also addressed herself directly to Mr Trump in a tweet, writing: &ldquo;You are stoking white nationalism (because) you are angry that people like us are serving in Congress and fighting against your hate-filled agenda.&rdquo;You are stoking white nationalism bc you are angry that people like us are serving in Congress and fighting against your hate-filled agenda. &ldquo;America's answer to the intolerant man is diversity, the very diversity which our heritage of religious freedom has inspired.&rdquo; -RFKRepresentative Hakeem Jeffries, chairman of the House Democratic Caucus, summed up the Democratic response: &ldquo;Racial arsonist strikes again. Shut. Your. Reckless. Mouth.&rdquo;With his tweet, Mr Trump inserted himself further into a rift between Ms Pelosi and Ms Ocasio-Cortez, just two days after he offered an unsolicited defence of the Democratic speaker.Ms Pelosi has been seeking to minimise Ms Ocasio-Cortez&rsquo;s influence in the House Democratic caucus in recent days, prompting Ms Ocasio-Cortez to accuse Ms Pelosi of trying to marginalise women of colour.On Sunday, Mr Trump&rsquo;s tone took a turn.&ldquo;So interesting to see &lsquo;Progressive&rsquo; Democrat Congresswomen, who originally came from countries whose governments are a complete and total catastrophe, the worst, most corrupt and inept anywhere in the world (if they even have a functioning government at all), now loudly and viciously telling the people of the United States, the greatest and most powerful Nation on earth, how our government is to be run,&rdquo; he tweeted.&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t they go back and help fix the totally broken and crime infested places from which they came. Then come back and show us how it is done.&rdquo;He added: &ldquo;These places need your help badly, you can&rsquo;t leave fast enough. I&rsquo;m sure that Nancy Pelosi would be very happy to quickly work out free travel arrangements!&rdquo;&hellip;.and viciously telling the people of the United States, the greatest and most powerful Nation on earth, how our government is to be run. Why don&rsquo;t they go back and help fix the totally broken and crime infested places from which they came. Then come back and show us how&hellip;.The attacks may have been meant to widen the divides within the Democrat caucus, which has been riven by internal debate over how far left to go in countering Mr Trump and over whether to proceed with impeachment proceedings against the president. Instead, the president&rsquo;s tweets brought Democrats together.Former vice president Joe Biden, the Democratic presidential frontrunner, tweeted that Mr Trump &ldquo;continues to spew hateful rhetoric, sow division, and stoke racial tensions for his own political gain&rdquo;.&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s be clear about what this vile comment is: A racist and xenophobic attack on Democratic congresswomen,&rdquo; tweeted Senator Elizabeth Warren, a Democratic presidential candidate.Let&rsquo;s be clear about what this vile comment is: A racist and xenophobic attack on Democratic congresswomen. This *is* their country, regardless of whether or not Trump realizes it. They should be treated with respect. As president, I&rsquo;ll make sure of it. https://t.co/WupieDquLAAnother 2020 contender, former Texas Representative Beto O&rsquo;Rourke, tweeted at the president: &ldquo;This is racist. These congresswomen are every bit as American as you &mdash; and represent our values better than you ever will.&rdquo; Congressional leaders, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, did not respond to requests for comment, nor did Senator Tim Scott of South Carolina, the only Republican black senator.Ms Ocasio-Cortez, who is of Puerto Rican descent, was born in the Bronx, New York, and raised in suburban Westchester County.Ms Pressley, the first black woman elected to the House from Massachusetts, was born in Cincinnati.Ms Omar, the first Somali native elected to Congress and one of its first Muslim women, was born in Somalia but spent much of her childhood in a Kenyan refugee camp as civil war tore apart her home country. She immigrated to the United States at age 12, teaching herself English by watching American TV and eventually settling with her family in Minneapolis.\""

They co-founded the firm in 2010 alongside Mark Textor.When the sugary drinks tax was unveiled in 2016, Mr Textor said: “You can’t tax people into healthy submission.” He said a sugar levy was “the bluntest of policy instruments”.CTF, which once worked for US tobacco giant Philip Morris, has given Johnson £23,000 in loans and donations for his bid to follow Theresa May .Vowing to review taxes aimed at boosting public health, Johnson said: “Is it sensible to put a tax on milkshakes...when the evidence seems ambiguous about whether those taxes actually help?” His review will not include tobacco and alcohol duties.Johnson has a key role at Westminster lobby firm CTF which he runs with Tory election guru Sir Lynton Crosby (left) (Image: Alan Davidson/The Picture Library Ltd)CTF’s clients are not named on the national register. Lobbyists only have to do so if they contact a permanent secretary or minister on clients’ behalf. Spinwatch’s Tamasin Cave said: “Industry now has an open door to someone likely to be our PM.”The CT Group, which owns CTF, said: “Mark Fullbrook has taken holiday to volunteer for Boris Johnson ’s leadership campaign and has no contact with any clients.“To suggest or imply that CT Group has anything to do with the campaign’s policy announcements is completely and utterly wrong and deliberately misleading.” Mr Johnson vowed to recruit 20,000 police by 2022, funding the £1.1billion move from the Chancellor’s £26billion “headroom” reserves.Three years ago, as London Mayor, he added 10p on sugary drinks in the cafe at his City Hall HQ and said tackling obesity was “one of the biggest” health challenges (file pic) (Image: Getty)Drinks levy worked like magic, says National Obesity Forum chairman Tam FryThe sugary drinks industry levy is the only successful anti-obesity measure that any government has introduced since the turn of the century.It sets levels for the sugar content in soft drinks. If manufacturers keep the level below 5g per 100ml they escape any levy.National Obesity Forum chairman Tam FryIf it rises, a financial penalty kicks in. The announcement worked like magic.Manufacturers began to strip the sugar content from the majority of their products, then lowered the prices for their healthier options and the public responded. It was a stroke of genius.Within months the sales of low sugar/no sugar drinks have increased by 50% in the UK and the sales of the full-sugar versions have declined by 12%.Read More'"

       "'REGINA — Saskatchewan\\'s highest court has dismissed a sentencing appeal\\xa0by a young man who fatally shot four people and wounded seven others in a northern community. The shooter was weeks shy of turning 18 when he killed two brothers at their home and a teacher and a teacher\\'s aide at the La Loche high school in 2016. He was sentenced as an adult\\xa0to life in prison with no chance of parole for 10 years after pleading guilty to first-degree murder, second-degree murder and attempted murder. The shooter\\xa0was looking for a youth sentence. In a 2-1 decision, the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal\\xa0ruled that it could find no errors in the\\xa0judge\\'s decision that a youth sentence was not sufficient to hold the shooter accountable. \"The sentencing judge reviewed the other factors including the absence of a criminal record, the lack of (his) insight into why he committed the offences, his lack of insight into the effect on the victims at the school, his prospects for treatment and rehabilitation, his risk to reoffend, whether the duration of the external controls and monitoring available under a youth sentence would be sufficient,\" Justices Jerome Tholl and Robert Richards wrote in the decision released Thursday. \"After doing so, she determined a youth sentence was not sufficient to hold (him) accountable for his actions.\" In a dissenting ruling, Justice Georgina Jackson said she would have allowed the appeal and set aside the\\xa0adult sentence. She said she would have replaced that with the maximum 10-year youth sentence divided\\xa0between six years in custody and four years in the community under supervision. Jackson said the shooter\\'s planning of the crime did not show strategic or analytical reasoning demonstrative of adult-like maturity. She also cited evidence that his background reduced his moral blameworthiness and his culpability. \"(He) was not living like an adult\\xa0— he was living like a child and one that was much younger than 17,\" she wrote. \"He was riding his bike, playing video games, skipping out of classes,\" Jackson wrote. \"He had committed no previous offences. He was totally dependent on others and vulnerable to the influence of others for food, clothing, shelter and marijuana. \"Finally, based on the experts’ evidence,\\xa0(his) cognitive limitations and his emotional and mental health played a role in the offending.\" When the appeal was heard last spring, the shooter\\'s lawyer, Aaron Fox, argued that his client faced cognitive and mental issues that affected his maturity and level of blame. Court heard the shooter has a low IQ, fetal alcohol spectrum disorder and has struggled with depression. Fox said the shooter did not have an escape plan nor did he attempt to disguise what he was about to do. He first posted online about his plan before driving to the high school. At the time of the shooting, he was repeating Grade 10 for a third time. This report by The Canadian Press was first published Oct. 31, 2019 The Canadian Press   '"

He trailed behind Sizemore until Fairborn police arrived. The front of the caller&rsquo;s car was hit with a bullet when driving on North Broad Street, but the caller himself was unharmed.Sizemore admitted to using methamphetamine on Thursday before the shooting incident, and police found what they suspect to be methamphetamine in his wallet, according to court documents.While a police officer transported Sizemore to the Fairborn jail, Sizemore told the officer he thought people were trying to kill him.'"

       "'  House Democrats are resuming public impeachment hearings on Wednesday with testimony from a central figure who could be their most important witness yet.Ambassador Gordon Sondland, scheduled to appear at 9 a.m. ET, was a big donor to President Trump\\'s inauguration and serves today as the United States envoy to the European Union.Sondland told House investigators that he delivered a key message to a Ukrainian official this year: Trump would not unfreeze more than $390 million in assistance for Ukraine unless Ukraine made a public statement committing to investigations Trump believed might help him in the 2020 election.That revelation was included in a three-page addendum filed this month to the first deposition Sondland gave in the earlier, closed-door chapter in the Ukraine affair.Initially the ambassador didn\\'t discuss that episode, which took place Sept. 1 in Warsaw. But the testimony of others, Sondland said, \"refreshed\" his recollection and accordingly he amended his testimony.Indispensable manWJCT is also broadcasting PBS NewsHour coverage of the impeachment hearings on TV channel 7.5 and NPR live coverage on 89.9 FM.The encounter in Poland is one of a number of episodes in the Ukraine affair in which Sondland was a star.Another was a July 10 meeting at the White House at which a Ukrainian delegation pressed for a meeting between the new president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, and Trump.Then-national security adviser John Bolton was cool to the idea, witnesses have said. He declined to commit. But Sondland said, according to others, that he already had an agreement with acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney for a meeting with Trump — if the Ukrainians agreed to investigations.Bolton and the national security professionals within the White House staff objected not only to having been boxed out of the shadow channel to Ukraine, but the merits of Trump\\'s strategy.Sondland also is one of the actors in the drama who can speak directly about what he heard from Trump.Witnesses have said that Sondland talked frequently with Trump by phone — even though that went outside the normal policy process — and the ambassador even dialed up the president on his mobile phone from a restaurant table this summer in Kyiv.Sondland was following up after the previous day\\'s phone call between Trump and Zelenskiy. Another witness has told House investigators that he overheard Trump ask Sondland about the investigations he wanted.Zelenskiy would do them, Sondland said, according to foreign service officer David Holmes, who was at the table across from Sondland. Holmes, who is posted to U.S. Embassy Kyiv, is scheduled to appear at Thursday\\'s impeachment hearing.The afternoon panelThe witnesses scheduled to appear on Wednesday afternoon have much lower profiles.One is Laura Cooper, a deputy assistant secretary at the Defense Department, whose portfolio includes policy for Eastern Europe.She\\'s expected to describe the Pentagon\\'s opposition to the White House\\'s freeze on Ukraine assistance and her conversations with Ambassador Kurt Volker, who testified on Tuesday, about the anticorruption statement.The other is David Hale, undersecretary of state for political affairs at the State Department. Hale is expected to give the Washington foreign policy perspective on the events of this year, including the scourging and removal of then-U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch, who was recalled in an early phase of the saga.Hale told House investigators that when people were appealing to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to support Yovanovitch — which he ultimately declined to do — he agreed to call Fox News host Sean Hannity and ask about the \"evidence\" that might be problematic for Yovanovitch.Hale said he had been beyond the periphery of many of the events in the story. For example, he said he was surprised to read the White House\\'s account of the July 25 phone call in which Trump asked Zelenskiy for a \"favor.\"\"It did surprise me,\" Hale said. \"I didn\\'t know any of that was happening.\"\"It\\'s inconceivable to me that there would be 67 to remove the president from office,\" McConnell said.

Vancouver Coastal Health said the two new cases are not related to the outbreak involving two French language schools. The health authority said the two people were infected while they were travelling, but has only specified that one of them went to the Philippines. A spokesperson with the Ministry of Health confirmed to CTV News the second person had also travelled to the island nation.  VCH said the first measles patient arrived at the YVR on Feb. 11 on Philippine Airlines flight PR 116 from Manila and had a one-night layover. The patient left Vancouver to Edmonton on Air Canada Flight AC236 on Feb. 12. \\\"The safety and security of our passengers, employees and community is our top priority. We recommend anyone who was on the flights or in the terminal at YVR on those days and may be experiencing symptoms to contact 811 to talk to a nurse,\\\" YVR spokesperson Chris Devauld said in an e-mail. The second measles patient is a resident of the Lower Mainland and was infectious when they went to a restaurant and mall in Richmond, according to the health authority. VCH identified several places where people may have been exposed to the highly contagious virus, including: YVR, international arrivals and customs area between 4 and 7 p.m. on Feb. 11 Shuttle bus from YVR to La Quinta Inn in Richmond between 5 to 7 p.m. on Feb. 11 Shuttle bus from YVR to La Quinta Inn in Richmond between 8 and 10:30 a.m. on Feb. 12 YVR, Air Canada domestic departures area between 9 a.m. and noon on Feb. 12 Little Onpin Restaurant in Richmond between 6 and 10 p.m. on Feb. 16 Toys R Us at Lansdowne Centre between 11 a.m. and 9 p.m. on Feb. 17 Toys R Us at Lansdowne Centre between 11 a.m. and 9 p.m. on Feb. 18 'We can do better'  Health officials said those who have never had the measles or did not have the two doses of the vaccine are at the highest risk of contracting the virus. They encourage people to get fully immunized, adding the shot is free for everyone. Health Minister Adrian Dix assures all British Columbians that there is enough vaccine to deal with the demand. \\\"Frankly, people shouldn't be getting measles in the 21st century in British Columbia,\\\" he said. \\\"While our healthcare system is doing very well, I think can we do better and we will do better.\\\" Health Minister Dix says BC is in communications with other provinces and Washington State about the measles outbreak. Says 12 cases is too many and again implores people to get vaccinated @CTVVancouverpic.twitter.com/c1NjsbpeNi Other cases linked to French schools  On Friday, Vancouver Coastal Health announced there was a total of 10 cases that were \\\"very clearly associated\\\" with the schools, Ecole Secondaire Jules-Verne and Ecole Rose-Des-Vents. Officials said 33 students at the two schools have been ordered to stay home because they haven't provided proof of measles vaccination.  The other three cases were contracted while travelling and one unrelated case was acquired locally, according to VCH. Health officials are reminding people they can get vaccinations by visiting their family doctor, a walk-in clinic or urgent primary care centre, or a pharmacy for adults or children over five years old. Calling ahead is also recommended.\""

The stakes are high for NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh in a Metro Vancouver byelection race, but an expert says recent Liberal turmoil has been a \\\"gift\\\" to his campaign. The 40-year-old former Ontario legislator has lacked a voice in Parliament since becoming party leader in the fall of 2017. Now he finally has his chance in Burnaby South as voters in the riding cast their ballots on Monday after a six-week race. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Darryl Dyck   The stakes are high for NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh in a Metro Vancouver byelection race, but an expert says recent Liberal turmoil has been a \\\"gift\\\" to his campaign. The 40-year-old former Ontario legislator has lacked a voice in Parliament since becoming party leader in the fall of 2017. Now he finally has his chance in Burnaby South as voters in the riding cast their ballots on Monday after a six-week race. The Liberals got off to a rocky start when their first candidate, Karen Wang, resigned after pointing out Singh's ethnicity online. In recent weeks, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has been besieged by allegations his office pressured former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould to stop a criminal prosecution of SNC-Lavalin. Singh said he's not taking anything for granted but he's confident his hard work to connect with voters will pay off. \\\"I think people are very disappointed with what's going on with the Liberal government,\\\" he said. \\\"Canadians expect our government works in our interest. It looks more and more like this government and Mr. Trudeau and the Liberal party are working in the interest of a massive multinational corporation.\\\" Trudeau has denied he or his office directed Wilson-Raybould on the matter. Michael Wernick, clerk of the Privy Council, recently said Trudeau repeatedly assured Wilson-Raybould a decision on the prosecution was hers alone to make. Richard T. Lee, the Liberal candidate who replaced Wang in Burnaby South, said few people are raising the issue on the doorstep. \\\"I understand some people are concerned about that, but the office of the prime minister and the prime minister himself have made a statement already,\\\" he said. Byelections typically have low turnouts, but there is evidence the results of them are driven by the popularity of the government and its leader, said Richard Johnston, a University of British Columbia political science professor. \\\"(Singh) may have been handed the gift of some voters as a result of all this,\\\" he said. \\\"Although it's just one thing amongst many, boy, he could use a win right now.\\\" Singh has faced criticism for poor fundraising and low poll numbers. Burnaby South occupies historically strong NDP territory, so if Singh can't win in the riding, it adds to the interpretation that he hasn't secured the support of party loyalists, said Johnston. The NDP beat the Liberals by just over 500 votes in the riding in 2015, but Johnston said he never expected the Liberals to do as well this time in Burnaby South. \\\"That was kind of a high point and their support might drop even further,\\\" he said. Lee said local issues, especially affordable housing, are more important to Burnaby South voters than the situation in Ottawa. He has touted the Liberal government's national housing strategy, which promises $40 billion over 10 years, while Conservative candidate Jay Shin has called for lower taxes and job-creation measures to help residents earn and save more money. Singh has unveiled a plan to build 500,000 affordable homes across Canada. He challenged Trudeau to eliminate the GST for developers building affordable homes, subsidize low-income renters and double the first-time homebuyers' tax credit. Byelections will also take place in York-Simcoe in Ontario and Outremont in Montreal on Monday. The results might provide insight into whether Quebec MP Maxime Bernier's new right-wing People's Party of Canada can snatch votes from the Conservatives. A recent debate in Burnaby South became heated when People's Party candidate Laura-Lynn Tyler Thompson discussed immigration. An online video of the debate shows Singh urging audience members to recognize they are all immigrants, unless they are Indigenous. When Tyler Thompson raises the murder of Burnaby teen Marrisa Shen \\u2014 in which a Syrian national has been charged \\u2014 to argue for more careful vetting of refugees, an audience member yells: \\\"That is racist! Shame on you!\\\" \\\"It's not racist to have safety,\\\" replies Tyler Thompson. Shin, the Conservative candidate, recently distributed flyers taking aim at Tyler Thompson, accusing her of supporting supervised injection sites and the legalization of marijuana, which she described as a \\\"smear campaign\\\" based on \\\"lies.\\\" However, Shin said he isn't worried about Tyler Thompson and doesn't think her message is resonating. \\\"When I speak with voters at the doors, I don't get a sense of that at all,\\\" he said. Tyler Thompson, a former Christian TV show host who opposes abortion and has protested teaching resources that educate kids about gay and transgender identities, said she believes the Conservatives are threatened by the People's Party. \\\"My message is resonating with Canadians because they like my strong stance for family.\\\" \"\n",

Vancouver Coastal Health said the two new cases are not related to the outbreak involving two French language schools. The health authority said the two people were infected while they were travelling, but has only specified that one of them went to the Philippines. A spokesperson with the Ministry of Health confirmed to CTV News the second person had also travelled to the island nation.  VCH said the first measles patient arrived at the YVR on Feb. 11 on Philippine Airlines flight PR 116 from Manila and had a one-night layover. The patient left Vancouver to Edmonton on Air Canada Flight AC236 on Feb. 12. \\\"The safety and security of our passengers, employees and community is our top priority. We recommend anyone who was on the flights or in the terminal at YVR on those days and may be experiencing symptoms to contact 811 to talk to a nurse,\\\" YVR spokesperson Chris Devauld said in an e-mail. The second measles patient is a resident of the Lower Mainland and was infectious when they went to a restaurant and mall in Richmond, according to the health authority. VCH identified several places where people may have been exposed to the highly contagious virus, including: YVR, international arrivals and customs area between 4 and 7 p.m. on Feb. 11 Shuttle bus from YVR to La Quinta Inn in Richmond between 5 to 7 p.m. on Feb. 11 Shuttle bus from YVR to La Quinta Inn in Richmond between 8 and 10:30 a.m. on Feb. 12 YVR, Air Canada domestic departures area between 9 a.m. and noon on Feb. 12 Little Onpin Restaurant in Richmond between 6 and 10 p.m. on Feb. 16 Toys R Us at Lansdowne Centre between 11 a.m. and 9 p.m. on Feb. 17 Toys R Us at Lansdowne Centre between 11 a.m. and 9 p.m. on Feb. 18 'We can do better'  Health officials said those who have never had the measles or did not have the two doses of the vaccine are at the highest risk of contracting the virus. They encourage people to get fully immunized, adding the shot is free for everyone. Health Minister Adrian Dix assures all British Columbians that there is enough vaccine to deal with the demand. \\\"Frankly, people shouldn't be getting measles in the 21st century in British Columbia,\\\" he said. \\\"While our healthcare system is doing very well, I think can we do better and we will do better.\\\" Health Minister Dix says BC is in communications with other provinces and Washington State about the measles outbreak. Says 12 cases is too many and again implores people to get vaccinated @CTVVancouverpic.twitter.com/c1NjsbpeNi Other cases linked to French schools  On Friday, Vancouver Coastal Health announced there was a total of 10 cases that were \\\"very clearly associated\\\" with the schools, Ecole Secondaire Jules-Verne and Ecole Rose-Des-Vents. Officials said 33 students at the two schools have been ordered to stay home because they haven't provided proof of measles vaccination.  The other three cases were contracted while travelling and one unrelated case was acquired locally, according to VCH. Health officials are reminding people they can get vaccinations by visiting their family doctor, a walk-in clinic or urgent primary care centre, or a pharmacy for adults or children over five years old. Calling ahead is also recommended.\"\n",

Close contact is not needed for transmission,\\u201d VCH said in a press release. \\u201cThe disease can also be spread through sharing food, drinks, cigarettes, or kissing an infected person,\\u201d the release goes on.According to VCH, people born before 1970 are likely immune to the disease.\"\n",

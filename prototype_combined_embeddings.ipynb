Vancouver Coastal Health said the two new cases are not related to the outbreak involving two French language schools. The health authority said the two people were infected while they were travelling, but has only specified that one of them went to the Philippines. A spokesperson with the Ministry of Health confirmed to CTV News the second person had also travelled to the island nation.  VCH said the first measles patient arrived at the YVR on Feb. 11 on Philippine Airlines flight PR 116 from Manila and had a one-night layover. The patient left Vancouver to Edmonton on Air Canada Flight AC236 on Feb. 12. \\\"The safety and security of our passengers, employees and community is our top priority. We recommend anyone who was on the flights or in the terminal at YVR on those days and may be experiencing symptoms to contact 811 to talk to a nurse,\\\" YVR spokesperson Chris Devauld said in an e-mail. The second measles patient is a resident of the Lower Mainland and was infectious when they went to a restaurant and mall in Richmond, according to the health authority. VCH identified several places where people may have been exposed to the highly contagious virus, including: YVR, international arrivals and customs area between 4 and 7 p.m. on Feb. 11 Shuttle bus from YVR to La Quinta Inn in Richmond between 5 to 7 p.m. on Feb. 11 Shuttle bus from YVR to La Quinta Inn in Richmond between 8 and 10:30 a.m. on Feb. 12 YVR, Air Canada domestic departures area between 9 a.m. and noon on Feb. 12 Little Onpin Restaurant in Richmond between 6 and 10 p.m. on Feb. 16 Toys R Us at Lansdowne Centre between 11 a.m. and 9 p.m. on Feb. 17 Toys R Us at Lansdowne Centre between 11 a.m. and 9 p.m. on Feb. 18 'We can do better'  Health officials said those who have never had the measles or did not have the two doses of the vaccine are at the highest risk of contracting the virus.

Officials said 33 students at the two schools have been ordered to stay home because they haven't provided proof of measles vaccination.  The other three cases were contracted while travelling and one unrelated case was acquired locally, according to VCH. Health officials are reminding people they can get vaccinations by visiting their family doctor, a walk-in clinic or urgent primary care centre, or a pharmacy for adults or children over five years old.

Many adults have only received one vaccine against measles, and therefore most cases are in this age group,\\\" he said.Most people born before 1966 will have been exposed to measles in childhood and will therefore be protected.The infected person was on a Jetstar flight from Sydney to Melbourne on Tuesday, March 19.However, adults born in or after 1966 may be susceptible, especially if overseas travel is planned, and should go to their doctor for a free vaccination.\\\"There is a lot of measles circulating in our region currently, including much of southeast and southern Asia. All travellers need to be aware of this risk,\\\" Dr Sutton said.Just two weeks ago, a Sydney resident developed measles a few days after returning home from the Philippines.The man in his 30s required hospitalisation for his symptoms but is no longer infectious and recovering at home.Earlier this month, NSW Health issued an urgent warning about measles over fears a young woman and baby were spreading the disease.The woman, who arrived in Sydney from Bali on Qantas flight QF44 about 6.30am on February 21, visited the international airport and Opera House as well as the Langham Hotel on Kent St in Sydney.The baby, who was too young to be vaccinated, developed the disease after arriving home from the Philippines.After a layover in Melbourne, the person then flew on a Virgin flight to Christchurch.Measles symptoms include fever, sore eyes and a cough followed by a red, blotchy rash on the head and neck that spreads to the rest of the body.\\\"If you develop symptoms, please call ahead to your GP so you do not wait in the waiting room with other patients,\\\" NSW Health director Vicky Sheppeard said.Measles is highly contagious and is spread in the air through coughing or sneezing by someone who is unwell with the disease.Cases of measles had soared worldwide because of complacency by parents who were not vaccinating their children, UNICEF said.Australia is at high risk of importing measles due to outbreaks of the disease in southeast Asia.\"\n",

      "     \"content_t\": \"A new case of measles has been confirmed on southern Vancouver Island a week after Island Health said two people who travelled abroad had been infected with the highly contagious disease. Island Health says it's now alerting people who may have been exposed to the latest measles patient at two locations on the Saanich Peninsula. The first exposure may have occurred between noon and 3 p.m. on March 30 at the Beacon Community Services Thrift Store on West Saanich Road. Another exposure may have occurred during the same time frame at Fairway Market on West Saanich Road. Anyone who was at either location during the specified times and has not been immunized for measles is advised to call the Saanich Health Unit to find out where to get vaccinated. Those exposed to measles who have been experiencing symptoms like fever, runny nose, sore throat, cough, diarrhea and red eyes followed by a rash that begins on the face and spreads to the chest are asked to contact their health care provider. According to experts, if a person is exposed to an infectious measles carrier they would show symptoms anywhere from 10 days to three weeks after the contact. It comes after two measles infections were confirmed on Vancouver Island in March. Both patients caught the measles while travelling in Vietnam, and have since made full recoveries. Island Health says the window of infection for those cases has closed, and the latest case does not appear to be linked. The outbreak has put a spotlight on the so-called anti-vaxxer movement and prompted the province to move ahead with a plan to have all students provide proof of immunization in B.C. schools. Island Health says in the last five weeks doctors have administered 3,474 measles vaccinations, more than double the number from 2018. The authority says two doses of measles vaccine is 99 per cent effective at preventing the disease. Island Health says anyone who wants to learn more about immunization services in their area can call a local information line:   South Island: 250-544-7676 ext. 27545  Nanaimo/Ladysmith/Gabriola: 250-755-3388  Courtenay/Comox Valley: 250-331-8599  Campbell River and area: 250-850-2120  Mt.

Within three to seven days, a red blotchy rash will appear, first on the face and then spreading to the body, arms and legs. If you believe that you have measles, you should isolate yourself by staying home and avoid all contact with unimmunized persons. Call before visiting your health care provider, so they can take precautions to protect other patients.Seventeen people have been diagnosed with the contagious disease in the Vancouver area since February and two cases each were identified on Vancouver Island and in 100 Mile House, in the southern Cariboo region of B.C.B.C. medical health officer Dr. Shovita Padhi of Fraser Health says the latest case involves a woman who lives between Burnaby and Hope and who acquired the infection overseas, similar to some of the past cases. He\\u00a0declined to say which country the woman had travelled to but said measles outbreaks are occurring in several parts of the world and it\\u2019s important to have two doses of the measles vaccine.Padhi added that the patient, who was unsure about whether she\\u2019d been immunized, sought medical attention after displaying classic symptoms of the disease.British Columbia is starting a two-month voluntary measles vaccine catch-up drive in an effort to vaccinate 95 per cent of youth before next fall\\u2019s mandatory immunization registration of students across the province.A county in New York City\\u2019s northern suburbs, meanwhile, declared a state of emergency last week over a measles outbreak that has infected more than 150 people since last fall, hoping a ban against unvaccinated children in public places wakes their parents to the seriousness of the problem.\\u201cIt\\u2019s an attention grab, there\\u2019s no question about it,\\u201d Rockland County Executive Ed Day said at a news conference, noting that he didn\\u2019t believe such a drastic step has ever been tried in the U.S. before.Day said he was taking the action in hopes of reversing a recent uptick in cases amid disturbing reports that health workers were encountering resistance when investigating cases. Rockland\\u2019s outbreak has most heavily affected Orthodox Jewish communities, in which vaccination rates tend to be lower.Under the declaration, which lasts for at least 30 days, anyone under 18 who is not vaccinated against measles is barred from public gathering places, including shopping malls, civic centres, schools, restaurants and even houses of worship. Those in violation could be charged with a misdemeanour punishable by up to six months in jail.The county is experiencing New York state\\u2019s longest measles outbreak since the disease was declared officially eliminated from the United States in 2000. Health officials say the best way to stop the disease\\u2019s spread is a vaccination rate in the community of 92 to 95 per cent.Day said only 72.9 per cent of people under 18 have been vaccinated against measles in Rockland County, which has more than 300,000 residents.With files from The Canadian Press and The Associated Press ALSO IN THE NEWS:\"\n",

      "     \"content_t\": \"Vancouver Coastal Health (VCH) has confirmed that there is an outbreak of measles in the city.  Dr. Althea Hayden told media late this afternoon there have been a total of eight confirmed cases in the city. There are five lab-confirmed cases at\\u00a0Jules-Verne Secondary School and\\u00a0Anne-Herbert Elementary School. There is a clinical case confirmed at\\u00a0Rose-Des-Vants Elementary School. Hayden says that there are also two \\u201csuspected cases\\u201d she cannot comment on. Cases are occurring in staff, students, and family members of those who attend the schools. Hayden confirmed that the measles was brought into this community through travel outside North America. Hayden says that this outbreak is unrelated to a case involving a gentleman who returned from the Philippines earlier this month. One patient was at BC Children\\u2019s Hospital emergency department while they were infectious and there is a risk of exposure for those who were there at the following times:   Jan. 21 from 10 am to 6:10 pm  Jan. 23 from 4:45 pm\\u00a0 to 11:10 pm  Jan. 24 from 8:13 am to 11:40 am  Feb. 1 from 2 pm to 6:55 pm  Anyone who was at the emergency department during those times and develops symptoms should contact their health care provider immediately. Symptoms of measles: Symptoms of measles include fever, cough, runny nose, and red and inflamed eyes (often sensitive to light), typically starting seven to 14 days after exposure. These are followed three to seven days later by a rash, which starts first on the face and neck, and spreads to the chest, arms and legs, and lasts at least three days. You may also notice spots inside your mouth that look like small grains of sand on a red base.   Check\\u00a0 your immunization records \\u00a0to make sure you and your children have had two doses of the measles vaccine (MMR or MMRV). Your immunization record or your doctor can provide you with this information. Adults 18 years of age and older, born in or after 1970 require two doses of measles vaccine; children 12 months to less than 18 years of age, health care workers and adults attending post-secondary institutions are required to have two doses; those born before 1970 are generally considered immune.  If your immunization record is not up-to-date, contact your local public health unit.  Infants under one year of age, pregnant women and people with weakened immune systems can get very ill with measles and should contact their health care professional immediately for further assessment.  Watch for symptoms of measles until 21 days after exposure. These include a high fever, cold-like symptoms (cough/runny nose); sore eyes or sensitivity to light; small spots with a white centre on the inside of the mouth; and a red rash lasting four to seven days.

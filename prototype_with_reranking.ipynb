Vancouver Coastal Health said the two new cases are not related to the outbreak involving two French language schools. The health authority said the two people were infected while they were travelling, but has only specified that one of them went to the Philippines. A spokesperson with the Ministry of Health confirmed to CTV News the second person had also travelled to the island nation.  VCH said the first measles patient arrived at the YVR on Feb. 11 on Philippine Airlines flight PR 116 from Manila and had a one-night layover. The patient left Vancouver to Edmonton on Air Canada Flight AC236 on Feb. 12. \\\"The safety and security of our passengers, employees and community is our top priority. We recommend anyone who was on the flights or in the terminal at YVR on those days and may be experiencing symptoms to contact 811 to talk to a nurse,\\\" YVR spokesperson Chris Devauld said in an e-mail. The second measles patient is a resident of the Lower Mainland and was infectious when they went to a restaurant and mall in Richmond, according to the health authority. VCH identified several places where people may have been exposed to the highly contagious virus, including: YVR, international arrivals and customs area between 4 and 7 p.m. on Feb. 11 Shuttle bus from YVR to La Quinta Inn in Richmond between 5 to 7 p.m. on Feb. 11 Shuttle bus from YVR to La Quinta Inn in Richmond between 8 and 10:30 a.m. on Feb. 12 YVR, Air Canada domestic departures area between 9 a.m. and noon on Feb. 12 Little Onpin Restaurant in Richmond between 6 and 10 p.m. on Feb. 16 Toys R Us at Lansdowne Centre between 11 a.m. and 9 p.m. on Feb. 17 Toys R Us at Lansdowne Centre between 11 a.m. and 9 p.m. on Feb. 18 'We can do better'  Health officials said those who have never had the measles or did not have the two doses of the vaccine are at the highest risk of contracting the virus. They encourage people to get fully immunized, adding the shot is free for everyone. Health Minister Adrian Dix assures all British Columbians that there is enough vaccine to deal with the demand. \\\"Frankly, people shouldn't be getting measles in the 21st century in British Columbia,\\\" he said. \\\"While our healthcare system is doing very well, I think can we do better and we will do better.\\\" Health Minister Dix says BC is in communications with other provinces and Washington State about the measles outbreak. Says 12 cases is too many and again implores people to get vaccinated @CTVVancouverpic.twitter.com/c1NjsbpeNi Other cases linked to French schools  On Friday, Vancouver Coastal Health announced there was a total of 10 cases that were \\\"very clearly associated\\\" with the schools, Ecole Secondaire Jules-Verne and Ecole Rose-Des-Vents. Officials said 33 students at the two schools have been ordered to stay home because they haven't provided proof of measles vaccination.  The other three cases were contracted while travelling and one unrelated case was acquired locally, according to VCH. Health officials are reminding people they can get vaccinations by visiting their family doctor, a walk-in clinic or urgent primary care centre, or a pharmacy for adults or children over five years old. Calling ahead is also recommended.\""

The stakes are high for NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh in a Metro Vancouver byelection race, but an expert says recent Liberal turmoil has been a \\\"gift\\\" to his campaign. The 40-year-old former Ontario legislator has lacked a voice in Parliament since becoming party leader in the fall of 2017. Now he finally has his chance in Burnaby South as voters in the riding cast their ballots on Monday after a six-week race. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Darryl Dyck   The stakes are high for NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh in a Metro Vancouver byelection race, but an expert says recent Liberal turmoil has been a \\\"gift\\\" to his campaign. The 40-year-old former Ontario legislator has lacked a voice in Parliament since becoming party leader in the fall of 2017. Now he finally has his chance in Burnaby South as voters in the riding cast their ballots on Monday after a six-week race. The Liberals got off to a rocky start when their first candidate, Karen Wang, resigned after pointing out Singh's ethnicity online. In recent weeks, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has been besieged by allegations his office pressured former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould to stop a criminal prosecution of SNC-Lavalin. Singh said he's not taking anything for granted but he's confident his hard work to connect with voters will pay off. \\\"I think people are very disappointed with what's going on with the Liberal government,\\\" he said. \\\"Canadians expect our government works in our interest. It looks more and more like this government and Mr. Trudeau and the Liberal party are working in the interest of a massive multinational corporation.\\\" Trudeau has denied he or his office directed Wilson-Raybould on the matter. Michael Wernick, clerk of the Privy Council, recently said Trudeau repeatedly assured Wilson-Raybould a decision on the prosecution was hers alone to make. Richard T. Lee, the Liberal candidate who replaced Wang in Burnaby South, said few people are raising the issue on the doorstep. \\\"I understand some people are concerned about that, but the office of the prime minister and the prime minister himself have made a statement already,\\\" he said. Byelections typically have low turnouts, but there is evidence the results of them are driven by the popularity of the government and its leader, said Richard Johnston, a University of British Columbia political science professor. \\\"(Singh) may have been handed the gift of some voters as a result of all this,\\\" he said. \\\"Although it's just one thing amongst many, boy, he could use a win right now.\\\" Singh has faced criticism for poor fundraising and low poll numbers. Burnaby South occupies historically strong NDP territory, so if Singh can't win in the riding, it adds to the interpretation that he hasn't secured the support of party loyalists, said Johnston. The NDP beat the Liberals by just over 500 votes in the riding in 2015, but Johnston said he never expected the Liberals to do as well this time in Burnaby South. \\\"That was kind of a high point and their support might drop even further,\\\" he said. Lee said local issues, especially affordable housing, are more important to Burnaby South voters than the situation in Ottawa. He has touted the Liberal government's national housing strategy, which promises $40 billion over 10 years, while Conservative candidate Jay Shin has called for lower taxes and job-creation measures to help residents earn and save more money. Singh has unveiled a plan to build 500,000 affordable homes across Canada. He challenged Trudeau to eliminate the GST for developers building affordable homes, subsidize low-income renters and double the first-time homebuyers' tax credit. Byelections will also take place in York-Simcoe in Ontario and Outremont in Montreal on Monday. The results might provide insight into whether Quebec MP Maxime Bernier's new right-wing People's Party of Canada can snatch votes from the Conservatives. A recent debate in Burnaby South became heated when People's Party candidate Laura-Lynn Tyler Thompson discussed immigration. An online video of the debate shows Singh urging audience members to recognize they are all immigrants, unless they are Indigenous. When Tyler Thompson raises the murder of Burnaby teen Marrisa Shen \\u2014 in which a Syrian national has been charged \\u2014 to argue for more careful vetting of refugees, an audience member yells: \\\"That is racist! Shame on you!\\\" \\\"It's not racist to have safety,\\\" replies Tyler Thompson. Shin, the Conservative candidate, recently distributed flyers taking aim at Tyler Thompson, accusing her of supporting supervised injection sites and the legalization of marijuana, which she described as a \\\"smear campaign\\\" based on \\\"lies.\\\" However, Shin said he isn't worried about Tyler Thompson and doesn't think her message is resonating. \\\"When I speak with voters at the doors, I don't get a sense of that at all,\\\" he said. Tyler Thompson, a former Christian TV show host who opposes abortion and has protested teaching resources that educate kids about gay and transgender identities, said she believes the Conservatives are threatened by the People's Party. \\\"My message is resonating with Canadians because they like my strong stance for family.\\\" \"\n",

A medical health officer in Vancouver says measles is not expected to spread beyond a cluster of patients, but anyone travelling to other parts of the world should ensure they are vaccinated against the contagious disease. Dr. Reka Gustafson of Vancouver Coastal Health says people often go to a travel clinic before a trip to get protection against diseases that don't circulate locally and it's a good opportunity to ensure all childhood vaccinations are up to date. She says most people in B.C. are vaccinated and older adults may already have had measles but anyone born after 1970 should ensure they have two doses of a vaccine, which is routinely given to children at age one and then between the ages of four and six. Two new cases were reported in the province Sunday, bringing the total to 13, with most of them linked to two French-language schools after an unvaccinated child contracted the disease during a trip to Vietnam. Gustafson says it took a week to get all the students' immunization records and improvements are needed to ensure a quicker system limits disruption to families as well as use of health-care resources. Symptoms of measles include a runny nose, cough, fever, red, itchy eyes and sometimes a rash, and Gustafson says parents who suspect their child has the disease should call their doctor's office in advance in order to get a separate room. Meanwhile, CTV News reports one of the recently reported cases involved an employee at a Richmond Toys \\\"R\\\" Us store. Notices have been posted at the Lansdowne Centre outlet, warning shoppers they may have been exposed on Feb. 17 and 18. \\u2013 with files from CTV Vancouver  \"\n",

      "     \"content_t\": \"A new case of measles has been confirmed on southern Vancouver Island a week after Island Health said two people who travelled abroad had been infected with the highly contagious disease. Island Health says it's now alerting people who may have been exposed to the latest measles patient at two locations on the Saanich Peninsula. The first exposure may have occurred between noon and 3 p.m. on March 30 at the Beacon Community Services Thrift Store on West Saanich Road. Another exposure may have occurred during the same time frame at Fairway Market on West Saanich Road. Anyone who was at either location during the specified times and has not been immunized for measles is advised to call the Saanich Health Unit to find out where to get vaccinated. Those exposed to measles who have been experiencing symptoms like fever, runny nose, sore throat, cough, diarrhea and red eyes followed by a rash that begins on the face and spreads to the chest are asked to contact their health care provider. According to experts, if a person is exposed to an infectious measles carrier they would show symptoms anywhere from 10 days to three weeks after the contact. It comes after two measles infections were confirmed on Vancouver Island in March. Both patients caught the measles while travelling in Vietnam, and have since made full recoveries. Island Health says the window of infection for those cases has closed, and the latest case does not appear to be linked. The outbreak has put a spotlight on the so-called anti-vaxxer movement and prompted the province to move ahead with a plan to have all students provide proof of immunization in B.C. schools. Island Health says in the last five weeks doctors have administered 3,474 measles vaccinations, more than double the number from 2018. The authority says two doses of measles vaccine is 99 per cent effective at preventing the disease. Island Health says anyone who wants to learn more about immunization services in their area can call a local information line:   South Island: 250-544-7676 ext. 27545  Nanaimo/Ladysmith/Gabriola: 250-755-3388  Courtenay/Comox Valley: 250-331-8599  Campbell River and area: 250-850-2120  Mt.

The individual flew on two China Southern flights on June 23 and 24 traveling from New Delhi to Vancouver, changing plans in Guangzhou.  \\u201cTravellers on one or both of these flights, as well as those in proximity to the case who travelled through YVR on Saturday, June 23 may have been exposed,\\u201d the BCCDC said in a statement. \\u201cSome potentially exposed passengers or flight crew may have been travelling to other destinations including within Canada.\\u201d The infectious individual was on China Southern flight CZ 3028 departing New Delhi on June 23 at 11:55 a.m. and arriving in Guangzhou at 7:40 p.m. The person then flew on China Southern flight CZ 377 departing Guangzhou on June 24 at 12:50 a.m. and landing in Vancouver on June 23 at 9:30 p.m. \\u201cMeasles is a highly infectious disease transmitted by airborne spread,\\u201d the CDC said. \\u201cTravellers on one or both of these flights are asked to check their immunization status.\\u201d It is expected that most travelers will be immune to the disease, however some individuals might be more susceptible, including children less than a year old or people who have never been immunized. The incubation period (the time it takes to develop symptoms after being exposed) for measles ranges from seven to 21 days, so a traveller infected with measles on either flight would expect to develop symptoms by about July 15. Symptoms include: fever, cough, runny nose, red eyes and a rash that starts centrally, including on the face, spreads to the limbs and lasts at least three days. \\u201cMeasles can be a serious infection and is very infectious to others,\\u201d the CDC said. \\u201cIf you become ill with any of the above symptoms and suspect you may have measles, call your doctor and inform them that you may have been exposed to measles, so that s/he will arrange to see you in a manner that avoids infecting others in the waiting room.\\u201d Anyone concerned about potential exposure to measles but have no symptoms can call 811 and speak to a nurse. @JessicaEKerr \"\n",

Cascades Parkway, Portland from 5 to 11 p.m. Jan. 14.\\u2022 A Children\\u2019s Dentist, 101 NW 12th Ave., Battle Ground from 1:30 to 6 pm Tuesday, Jan. 8.  The measles outbreak in Clark County that has racked up 23 confirmed cases since Jan. 1 isn&#8217;t likely to go away or slow down any time soon, even though no new cases or exposure locations were confirmed today.There are seven suspected measles cases, according to a Clark County Public Health news release.Officials are also\\u00a0investigating a suspected case of the measles in King County.\\u00a0Public Health Seattle &amp; King County said Wednesday that the man in his 50s was hospitalized but has been released.\\u00a0Officials say the man had recently traveled to Vancouver, but it\\u2019s not clear if that\\u2019s where he was infected.Officials say results from additional testing to confirm the case are expected by the end of the week.At Wednesday morning&#8217;s Clark County Board of Health meeting, Clark County Public Health Officer Dr. Alan Melnick informed the Clark County Council that the measles outbreak could last months, spread into other Washington counties, south to Oregon and possibly cost Clark County hundreds of thousands of dollars.Melnick said the first several days of the outbreak response effort cost somewhere around $31,000.\\u201cThis is going to be likely, hundreds of thousands of dollars if not more,&#8221; Melnick told the council. &#8220;This is going to be pretty expensive.\\u201dIt&#8217;s even possible the outbreak could be declared a statewide emergency, after being declared a Clark County health emergency by the council last week. A statewide declaration would most likely happen if the outbreak continues to increase in numbers, and reaches other counties, Melnick said.\\u201cIt\\u2019s very possible that we\\u2019ll be seeing cases outside of Clark County, including other spots in Washington as well as to our neighbors to the south,&#8221; Melnick said.The time from when you get exposed to measles to when you develop symptoms and become contagious ranges from seven to 21 days, Melnick said.\\u00a0Melnick said the outbreak is reaching the third or fourth generation now, meaning the outbreak starts with a case that then infects secondary cases, and then those cases infect new people and it starts multiplying and creating new generations.&#8220;We\\u2019re getting into the third and fourth generation and as you can imagine the numbers can increase,&#8221; he told the council. &#8220;I\\u2019m hoping some of the measures we\\u2019ve taken can reduce that. But there\\u2019s a good possibility well be dealing with measles in continuing numbers and perhaps even increasing numbers in the next few weeks and months.\\u201dA statewide emergency means that federal resources can be tapped. Melnick said Clark County Public Health is being stretched somewhat thin by the outbreak. Public Health is having to pull staff from other departments to help assist in the response.Some food inspectors have shifted over in the response effort, which means they&#8217;re not only leaving their main duties, but also leaving a role (food inspection) that collects fees for the county.\\u201cThis basically impacts everything that we do,&#8221; Melnick said. &#8220;But we are faced with this potentially deadly outbreak here and it\\u2019s a matter of prioritizing our resources and it\\u2019s kind of all hands on deck right now.\\u201dCouncil Chair Eileen Quiring discussed with Melnick the reasons for Clark County&#8217;s low vaccination rates, which Melnick said were low for Washington and the U.S.\\u201cIn the 25 years that I\\u2019ve known about immunizations and the controversy over it, there are things on the web and there are organizations that say that vaccinations cause autism and that\\u2019s why some parents are reluctant to have their children vaccinated,\\u201d\\u00a0Quiring said.Quiring explained that sometimes when people say something over and over and over again, others can perceive it as truth, even if it isn&#8217;t.Melnick noted Public Health is not only fighting an outbreak, but also a campaign against false information that appears frequently online.\\u201cUnfortunately there\\u2019s a lot of misinformation going around on social networks and some of it is very sophisticated looking and very well done,&#8221; Melnick said. &#8220;The link between vaccination and autism has been debunked a long time ago. There\\u2019s also misinformation going on about shedding the vaccine virus and causing other people to get infected. That\\u2019s also been debunked, but it\\u2019s very believable. I think that\\u2019s difficult for parents, because they look at this stuff and it seems very legitimate. But it\\u2019s not true. That\\u2019s what we\\u2019re up against.\\u201dMelnick explained the low rates for vaccination mostly stemmed from people requesting personal and philosophical exemptions. He said that religious exemptions are rare, as are health-related exemptions.That&#8217;s been curbed some recently because in the last couple years legislation was passed that required parents to meet with a medical provider to discuss vaccines and personal exemptions. Regardless, Melnick said Clark County&#8217;s vaccination rates are too low.At the 11 schools for which immunization data was available, 678 of 6,958 students were listed as being exempt from receiving their measles, mumps and rubella vaccines during the 2017-2018 school year.According to the Washington State Department of Health, Battle Ground Public School\\u2019s River HomeLink has the highest rate of students who do not have MMR shots. Of the 1,019 students enrolled at the school, 239, or 23.5 percent, are not immunized against the highly contagious virus.Data was not available for Slavic Christian Academy, a private school located in Orchards.Clark County Public Health is requiring exclusion of students and staff without documented immunity to measles from only schools identified as possible exposure sites. Students and staff excluded from those identified schools are also excluded from other schools, child care and other congregate settings.Students and staff at schools where measles exposure did not occur are not impacted by exclusions.Melnick said it would be tragic for a child to die because of the outbreak, and mentioned that if everyone was vaccinated, measles could be eliminated. He also explained that about 400 to 500 people died per year from measles before the vaccine.Council member Julie Olson, who represents District 2, wished that people would take the disease more seriously.\\u201cThis a preventable disease,&#8221; Olson said. &#8220;The idea that it is not dangerous is just wrong. That we allow our children to be exposed to this kind of illness and put them through this kind of suffering is unconscionable.\\u201dThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports that 90 percent of unvaccinated people exposed to the measles virus develop the disease. The virus lives in the nose and throat mucus of an infected person, and can survive for up to two hours in an airspace where the infected person coughed or sneezed.Health officials are urging anyone who has been exposed at an identified location and believes they have symptoms of measles to call their health care provider prior to visiting the medical office to make a plan that avoids exposing others in the waiting room.If you are unsure of your family\\u2019s immunization status, you can view, download and print your family\\u2019s immunization information online at MyIR.net or request a copy of your immunization record from the Washington State Department of Health.Anyone with questions about measles infection or the measles vaccine should call their primary care provider or a county health department:\\u2022\\u00a0Clark County Public Health, 360-397-8021\\u2022\\u00a0Multnomah County Public Health, 503-988-3406\\u2022\\u00a0Washington County Public Health, 503-846-3594\\u2022\\u00a0Clackamas County Public Health, 503-655-8411Public Health has identified additional locations where people may have been exposed to measles. There are dozens of locations in total, including hospitals, Portland International Airport and multiple schools. For a complete list of exposure sites,\\u00a0visit the Public Health measles investigation webpage.Measles symptoms begin with a high fever, cough, runny nose and red eyes, followed by a rash that usually begins at the head and spreads to the rest of the body. A person can spread the virus before they show symptoms. People are contagious with measles for up to four days before and up to four days after the rash appears.\\u00a0After someone is exposed to measles, illness develops in about one to three weeks.\"\n",

Regina Leader-Post  Updated: June 13, 2019         The measles case was confirmed in a returning traveller who had flown into the Regina International Airport on June 9 after overseas travel.   PROVINCE      Share  Adjust  Comment  Print  The Saskatchewan Health Authority has confirmed a case of measles in Yorkton and is alerting those who may have been exposed to the highly infectious disease.The measles case was confirmed in a returning traveller who had flown into the Regina International Airport on June 9 after overseas travel.The passenger with measles boarded Air China Limited flight CA 0948 departing from Delhi\\u2019s Indira Gandhi International Airport (DEL) at 2:50 a.m. and arrived at Beijing Capital International Airport (PEK) at 11:25 a.m. The passenger was at PEK until boarding Air China Limited flight CA 0991 at 3:25 p.m., which arrived at Vancouver International Airport (YVR) at 10:50 a.m. The SHA issued an exposure alert for people on those flights and anyone in Vancouver\\u2019s main airport terminal at approximately 10:50 a.m., with the path of travel through Canada Customs and Immigration shortly after.The passenger with measles then departed YVR on Air Canada flight AC 8572 at 2 p.m., arriving at Regina International Airport (YQR) at 5 p.m. The SHA is also issuing an exposure alert for those who were at YQR\\u2019s arrivals and baggage area between 5 and 8 p.m.People who were at the Yorkton Regional Health Centre between 8 p.m. June 9 and 3:40 a.m. June 10 may also have been exposed to measles.\\u201cIf you have been on any of these flights or in the airport or in the Yorkton Regional Health Centre during the times above, and are pregnant, immunosuppressed or under the age of one, you may qualify for preventative treatment,\\u201d the SHA said in its alert.\\u201cPassengers, crew, travellers and area residents who may have come into contact with measles as above, and are unsure of their immunization against measles, are asked to contact their local Public Health Office.\\u201dWhile it is expected that the majority of travellers will be immune to measles, which is transmitted by airborne spread, some people may be susceptible, including infants less than one year old, immunosuppressed people or those who have never been immunized against measles.Individuals born after 1970 should have received two doses of a measles vaccine (often given as combined measles, mumps and rubella vaccine, or MMR) to be protected. Those who were born prior to 1970 are likely to be immune due to prior measles infection.Infected individuals are likely to develop symptoms within 7 to 21 days of being exposed. Symptoms of measles include fever, cough, runny nose, red eyes and a rash that starts centrally (including on the face), spreads to the limbs and lasts at leas three days.If you develop any of these symptoms of measles and suspect you may have measles, call ahead to your health care provider, and inform them that you may have been exposed to measles, so that she/he will arrange to see you in a manner that avoids infecting others in the waiting room.If you live in the\\u00a0Yorkton or surrounding area, please call\\u00a01-866-343-1460.If you live in Regina or surrounding area, please call 306-766-7790.In Saskatchewan, for general inquiries regarding measles, please contact HealthLine at 811.If you reside elsewhere, please call your local Public Health Office.

A recent measles outbreak has sickened dozens of people in the Pacific Northwest, most in Washington state and, of those, most are concentrated in Clark County, just north of Portland, Oregon. Washington Gov. Jay Inslee declared a state of emergency over the outbreak last month. (AP Photo/Elaine Thompson)VANCOUVER \\u2013 British Columbia\\u2019s health minister is urging people to get vaccinated to protect themselves from measles after a fourth case of the disease was confirmed in Vancouver. Adrian Dix says it\\u2019s the responsibility of parents to ensure their children are vaccinated and to also think of other people\\u2019s kids who could be infected with the contagious disease. He says vaccination rates could be higher and anyone who needs more information should contact their local health authority. Vancouver Coastal Health says three measles cases were confirmed this week and the first person who tested positive acquired the infection outside of North America. It says all the cases involve three French schools, two of the schools are connected by a door and all of them use the same school-bus company.

Many adults have only received one vaccine against measles, and therefore most cases are in this age group,\\\" he said.Most people born before 1966 will have been exposed to measles in childhood and will therefore be protected.The infected person was on a Jetstar flight from Sydney to Melbourne on Tuesday, March 19.However, adults born in or after 1966 may be susceptible, especially if overseas travel is planned, and should go to their doctor for a free vaccination.\\\"There is a lot of measles circulating in our region currently, including much of southeast and southern Asia. All travellers need to be aware of this risk,\\\" Dr Sutton said.Just two weeks ago, a Sydney resident developed measles a few days after returning home from the Philippines.The man in his 30s required hospitalisation for his symptoms but is no longer infectious and recovering at home.Earlier this month, NSW Health issued an urgent warning about measles over fears a young woman and baby were spreading the disease.The woman, who arrived in Sydney from Bali on Qantas flight QF44 about 6.30am on February 21, visited the international airport and Opera House as well as the Langham Hotel on Kent St in Sydney.The baby, who was too young to be vaccinated, developed the disease after arriving home from the Philippines.After a layover in Melbourne, the person then flew on a Virgin flight to Christchurch.Measles symptoms include fever, sore eyes and a cough followed by a red, blotchy rash on the head and neck that spreads to the rest of the body.\\\"If you develop symptoms, please call ahead to your GP so you do not wait in the waiting room with other patients,\\\" NSW Health director Vicky Sheppeard said.Measles is highly contagious and is spread in the air through coughing or sneezing by someone who is unwell with the disease.Cases of measles had soared worldwide because of complacency by parents who were not vaccinating their children, UNICEF said.Australia is at high risk of importing measles due to outbreaks of the disease in southeast Asia.\"\n",

Many adults have only received one vaccine against measles, and therefore most cases are in this age group,\\\" he said.Most people born before 1966 will have been exposed to measles in childhood and will therefore be protected.The infected person was on a Jetstar flight from Sydney to Melbourne on Tuesday, March 19.However, adults born in or after 1966 may be susceptible, especially if overseas travel is planned, and should go to their doctor for a free vaccination.\\\"There is a lot of measles circulating in our region currently, including much of southeast and southern Asia. All travellers need to be aware of this risk,\\\" Dr Sutton said.Just two weeks ago, a Sydney resident developed measles a few days after returning home from the Philippines.The man in his 30s required hospitalisation for his symptoms but is no longer infectious and recovering at home.Earlier this month, NSW Health issued an urgent warning about measles over fears a young woman and baby were spreading the disease.The woman, who arrived in Sydney from Bali on Qantas flight QF44 about 6.30am on February 21, visited the international airport and Opera House as well as the Langham Hotel on Kent St in Sydney.The baby, who was too young to be vaccinated, developed the disease after arriving home from the Philippines.After a layover in Melbourne, the person then flew on a Virgin flight to Christchurch.Measles symptoms include fever, sore eyes and a cough followed by a red, blotchy rash on the head and neck that spreads to the rest of the body.\\\"If you develop symptoms, please call ahead to your GP so you do not wait in the waiting room with other patients,\\\" NSW Health director Vicky Sheppeard said.Measles is highly contagious and is spread in the air through coughing or sneezing by someone who is unwell with the disease.Cases of measles had soared worldwide because of complacency by parents who were not vaccinating their children, UNICEF said.Australia is at high risk of importing measles due to outbreaks of the disease in southeast Asia.\"\n",

Some comments on Facebook were speculating that a local child had been infected with measles while visiting Vancouver recently, where numerous cases of measles have been confirmed in recent weeks. RELATED STORY: TWO MORE MEASLES CASES IN B.C. BRINGS TOTAL TO 15 Asked for comment, Island Health has confirmed there are currently no lab-confirmed cases of measles anywhere on Vancouver Island. A statement from Island Health said the rumours circulating through social media about the alleged measles case in the Valley are the result of \\u201cheightened awareness and sensitivity as a result of the measles cases on the Lower Mainland.\\u201d The statement said Island Health could not comment on any specific case or patient, regardless if there were any truth to the rumours on social media. \\u201cDue to privacy laws and in support of Island Health\\u2019s confidentiality policies, we cannot discuss or disclose details about individual patients or the care they receive,\\u201d the statement said. \\u201cWhat we can say is that when people are sick, their primary care provider may order a variety of tests to determine the cause of the illness and to rule out other illnesses.\\u201d Fears of catching measles have been rampant across the province after at least 15 cases of measles were diagnosed in Vancouver in recent weeks after an unvaccinated Canadian child contracted the disease on a family trip to Vietnam. Pharmacists across the province are prepared to give booster shots or new vaccinations to adults and children five years or older, according to a statement from the B.C. Pharmacy Association in response to the measles outbreak in Vancouver. The measles, mumps and rubella vaccine is publicly funded and available from pharmacists in nearly every community, the association said. RELATED STORY: VANCOUVER MEASLES OUTBREAK PROMPTS VACCINE VIGILANCE ON ISLAND Cowichan Valley MLA Sonia Furstenau, who is the health critic for the B.C. Green caucus, said she is \\u201cdeeply concerned\\u201d for the people affected by the current measles outbreak in Vancouver and encourages all British Columbians who are medically able to be vaccinated to do so. \\u201cThe BC Green Party believes in evidence-based policy, and the evidence is clear that vaccinations save lives,\\u201d she said. \\u201cThe collective well being that comes from vaccinations is paramount, and we support the health minister\\u2019s efforts in this area.

Passengers, crew and travelers who may have come into contact with this case of measles are asked to be aware of this potential exposure should they develop symptoms compatible with measles.Most travellers will be immune to measles due to prior immunization, with older travellers immune from having had measles as a child, according to health officials.Those most likely to develop measles after exposure are infants less than one year old who have not been vaccinated, or others who have never been immunized against measles.If you become ill and suspect you may have measles from this or another exposure such as traveling overseas to the many parts of the world where measles occurs frequently, call your doctor and inform them that you may have measles, so that they can arrange to see you in a manner that avoids infecting others in the waiting room.You can also call your local health unit and ask for the communicable disease nurse.To find a public health unit anywhere in the province, use the locator on ImmunizeBC.caSymptoms of measles include:FeverCough Runny noseRed eyesRash that starts centrally including on the face, spreads to the limbs and lasts at least three daysNon-immune exposed individuals can become infected by being in the same airspace as a measles case. If infected, they will develop symptoms within 7 to 21 days of being exposed.Those who are concerned about their potential measles exposure but have no symptoms can call 8-1-1 and speak to a nurse.Individuals most at risk from measles are those who are completely unvaccinated against the disease including babies under one year of age. Individuals born after 1970 should have received two doses of a measles vaccine (often given as combined measles, mumps and rubella vaccine, or MMR) to be protected.Those who were born prior to 1970 are likely to be immune due to prior measles infection.The BCCDC advises British Columbians to review their immunization status prior to travel. Measles has been on the rise for several years worldwide including several countries in Europe and Southeast Asia, which are common travel destinations for British Columbians.The best time to protect yourself, officials add, is before you travel.\"\n",

Dr. Althea Hayden told media late this afternoon there have been a total of eight confirmed cases in the city. There are five lab-confirmed cases at\\u00a0Jules-Verne Secondary School and\\u00a0Anne-Herbert Elementary School. There is a clinical case confirmed at\\u00a0Rose-Des-Vants Elementary School. Hayden says that there are also two \\u201csuspected cases\\u201d she cannot comment on. Cases are occurring in staff, students, and family members of those who attend the schools. Hayden confirmed that the measles was brought into this community through travel outside North America. Hayden says that this outbreak is unrelated to a case involving a gentleman who returned from the Philippines earlier this month. One patient was at BC Children\\u2019s Hospital emergency department while they were infectious and there is a risk of exposure for those who were there at the following times:   Jan. 21 from 10 am to 6:10 pm  Jan. 23 from 4:45 pm\\u00a0 to 11:10 pm  Jan. 24 from 8:13 am to 11:40 am  Feb. 1 from 2 pm to 6:55 pm  Anyone who was at the emergency department during those times and develops symptoms should contact their health care provider immediately. Symptoms of measles: Symptoms of measles include fever, cough, runny nose, and red and inflamed eyes (often sensitive to light), typically starting seven to 14 days after exposure. These are followed three to seven days later by a rash, which starts first on the face and neck, and spreads to the chest, arms and legs, and lasts at least three days. You may also notice spots inside your mouth that look like small grains of sand on a red base.   Check\\u00a0 your immunization records \\u00a0to make sure you and your children have had two doses of the measles vaccine (MMR or MMRV). Your immunization record or your doctor can provide you with this information. Adults 18 years of age and older, born in or after 1970 require two doses of measles vaccine; children 12 months to less than 18 years of age, health care workers and adults attending post-secondary institutions are required to have two doses; those born before 1970 are generally considered immune.  If your immunization record is not up-to-date, contact your local public health unit.  Infants under one year of age, pregnant women and people with weakened immune systems can get very ill with measles and should contact their health care professional immediately for further assessment.  Watch for symptoms of measles until 21 days after exposure. These include a high fever, cold-like symptoms (cough/runny nose); sore eyes or sensitivity to light; small spots with a white centre on the inside of the mouth; and a red rash lasting four to seven days.

More specifically, anyone who spent time in Concourse D and the Delta Sky Lounge during that time period.Immunizations are the best protection against measles. One dose of the measles vaccine is about 93 percent effective at prevention, while two doses is about 97 percent effective, according to Public Health.Measles presents the biggest risk to those who have not been vaccinated, including infants younger than 12 months. You are likely immune to measles if you were born before 1957, have had measles before or are up to date on vaccinations (one dose for children 12 months through 3 years old, two doses in anyone 4 years and older).Illness can develop in about one to three weeks after exposure. Symptoms begin with a fever, cough, runny nose, and red eyes, which is followed by a rash that usually begins at the head and spreads over the body.Common complications of measles include ear infection, lung infection and diarrhea. Swelling of the brain is a rare but much more serious complication. Measles may also cause pregnant women to give birth prematurely, or have a low-birth-weight baby. For every 1,000 children with measles, one or two will die from the disease.The last time measles was confirmed in Clark County was in 2011. That year, three measles cases were confirmed. The first case of measles was diagnosed after someone traveled overseas and then returned to Clark County, said Marissa Armstrong, Clark County Public Health information officer. The other two cases were separate from the first, but linked to each other.There was also a measles case in July that Clark County Public Health felt comfortable confirming based off of the evidence of the case. There was, however, no lab test done because the family declined the test. Armstrong said the lack of test confirmation means the state will not conclusively confirm that case. The state and county have different confirmation guidelines.Melnick stressed that measles is a very serious disease, and explained that if everyone would get vaccinated for it, the disease could basically be eradicated. He said he\\u2019s seen people downplay the disease on social media, with an attitude that amounts to \\u201cIt\\u2019s just measles.\\u201d\\u201cIt ain\\u2019t \\u2018just measles,\\u2019 \\u201d Melnick said. \\u201cIt\\u2019s a bad disease.\\u201d\"\n",

Photo iStock                    VANCOUVER \\u2014 A medical health officer in Vancouver says measles is not expected to spread beyond a cluster of patients but anyone travelling to other parts of the world should ensure they are vaccinated against the contagious disease. Dr. Reka Gustafson of Vancouver Coastal Health says people often go to a travel clinic before a trip to get protection against diseases that don't circulate locally and it's a good opportunity to ensure all childhood vaccinations are up to date. She says most people in B.C. are vaccinated and older adults may already have had measles but anyone born after 1970 should ensure they have two doses of a vaccine, which is routinely given to children at age one and then between the ages of four and six. Two new cases were reported in the province Sunday, bringing the total to 13, with most of them linked to two French-language schools after an unvaccinated child contracted the disease during a trip to Vietnam. Gustafson says it took a week to get all the students' immunization records and improvements are needed to ensure a quicker system limits disruption to families as well as use of health-care resources. Symptoms of measles include a runny nose, cough, fever, red, itchy eyes and sometimes a rash, and Gustafson says parents who suspect their child has the disease should call their doctor's office in advance in order to get a separate room.\"\n",

NSW Health on Tuesday issued a warning to people who were on Singapore Airlines flight SQ221 from Singapore which arrived in Sydney on January 11.  Two children on the flight were diagnosed with measles on Tuesday. The children caught the train on Friday, January 11 from the International Airport to Meadowbank via Central.  People who may have come into contact with the children have been warned to be alert for symptoms until late January.  \\\"If you develop symptoms please call ahead to your GP so that you do not wait in the waiting room with other patients,\\\" communicable diseases director Dr Vicky Sheppeard said in a statement. The children were on board a Singapore Airlines flight. The warning comes a day after another airport measles scare involving a man who flew into Sydney from Manila on January 11.  The man in his 20s flew from Manila aboard Qantas flight QF20 which landed on Friday at about 6.30am.  He then visited a medical centre in Leichhardt where symptoms were identified and isolation measures put in place.  Vaccination rates for five-year-olds have increased from 88 per cent to 94.6 per cent between 2010 and 2017. (The national target is 95 per cent.)  On Monday, NSW Health said passengers on the Qantas flight and people at Sydney Airport on Friday morning should be alert until late January for symptoms such as fever, sore eyes and a cough. NSW Health on Monday said passengers on the Qantas flight and people at the airport on Friday morning should be alert for measles. It also said people travelling to South-East Asia where measles is prevalent should ensure they are fully vaccinated before setting off.  Symptoms of measles include fever, sore eyes and a cough, followed three or four days later by a red, blotchy rash, NSW Health says.  Six people have been diagnosed with measles in NSW since Christmas.  Symptoms usually occur about 10 to 12 days after infection. The measles-mumps-rubella vaccine is free for people aged one to 52. \"\n",

Island Health is warning of exposure at Royal Jubilee Hospital after two people were exposed and visited the hospital on March 6, 8 and 9. The infections were reportedly contracted while traveling abroad. \\u201cBased upon clinical management and prior immunization, we want to assure people that risk of transmission is extremely low,\\u201d said Dr. Richard Stanwick, Island Health chief medical health officer, in a news release. These mark the 21st and 22nd confirmed cases of measles since January across the province. Symptoms of the virus include fever, runny nose, sore throat, cough, diarrhea and red eyes, followed a few days later by a rash that starts on the face and spreads to the chest. If you develop symptoms, please contact your health care provider before you visit them so they can take precautions to prevent transmission of measles to others. Those who never had the measles infection, or who did not have two doses of vaccine, are at highest risk of measles, and are encouraged to get fully immunized.

They encourage people to get fully immunized, adding the shot is free for everyone. Health Minister Adrian Dix assures all British Columbians that there is enough vaccine to deal with the demand. \\\"Frankly, people shouldn't be getting measles in the 21st century in British Columbia,\\\" he said. \\\"While our healthcare system is doing very well, I think can we do better and we will do better.\\\" Health Minister Dix says BC is in communications with other provinces and Washington State about the measles outbreak.

Officials said 33 students at the two schools have been ordered to stay home because they haven't provided proof of measles vaccination.  The other three cases were contracted while travelling and one unrelated case was acquired locally, according to VCH. Health officials are reminding people they can get vaccinations by visiting their family doctor, a walk-in clinic or urgent primary care centre, or a pharmacy for adults or children over five years old.

Damien Healy, a spokesman for N.W.T. Health and Social Services, confirms that a person with measles who passed through Vancouver and Edmonton before flying to other destinations in the North is the same person. There was no immediate word on where the person had been before Vancouver. Health officials in B.C. have been investigating nearly a dozen measles cases in the Vancouver area. Many of them have been at two French-language schools in Vancouver, a cluster that began after an unvaccinated B.C. child contracted the disease during a family trip to Vietnam. Vancouver Coastal Health announced Sunday in a tweet there are two new cases of people who were infected while travelling. Health officials in both Alberta and the Northwest Territories advised people who aren't vaccinated for measles and who may have been on board flights, in shuttles, at stores or hotels where the affected person was present to monitor themselves for symptoms.

On Friday, Vancouver Coastal medical health officer Dr. Althea Hayden said nine of the cases were clearly associated with schools that were at the centre of the original outbreak this month, but they don't know where the other person contracted the disease. A number of specific public venues near Vancouver where people could have been exposed to measles have now been identified and listed here .\\u00a0 Measles at first presents with flu-like symptoms, coughing, a runny nose and red eyes, but then a fever develops, followed by the distinctive rash.

The stakes are high for NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh in a Metro Vancouver byelection race, but an expert says recent Liberal turmoil has been a \\\"gift\\\" to his campaign. The 40-year-old former Ontario legislator has lacked a voice in Parliament since becoming party leader in the fall of 2017. Now he finally has his chance in Burnaby South as voters in the riding cast their ballots on Monday after a six-week race. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Darryl Dyck   The stakes are high for NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh in a Metro Vancouver byelection race, but an expert says recent Liberal turmoil has been a \\\"gift\\\" to his campaign. The 40-year-old former Ontario legislator has lacked a voice in Parliament since becoming party leader in the fall of 2017. Now he finally has his chance in Burnaby South as voters in the riding cast their ballots on Monday after a six-week race. The Liberals got off to a rocky start when their first candidate, Karen Wang, resigned after pointing out Singh's ethnicity online. In recent weeks, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has been besieged by allegations his office pressured former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould to stop a criminal prosecution of SNC-Lavalin. Singh said he's not taking anything for granted but he's confident his hard work to connect with voters will pay off. \\\"I think people are very disappointed with what's going on with the Liberal government,\\\" he said. \\\"Canadians expect our government works in our interest. It looks more and more like this government and Mr. Trudeau and the Liberal party are working in the interest of a massive multinational corporation.\\\" Trudeau has denied he or his office directed Wilson-Raybould on the matter. Michael Wernick, clerk of the Privy Council, recently said Trudeau repeatedly assured Wilson-Raybould a decision on the prosecution was hers alone to make. Richard T. Lee, the Liberal candidate who replaced Wang in Burnaby South, said few people are raising the issue on the doorstep. \\\"I understand some people are concerned about that, but the office of the prime minister and the prime minister himself have made a statement already,\\\" he said. Byelections typically have low turnouts, but there is evidence the results of them are driven by the popularity of the government and its leader, said Richard Johnston, a University of British Columbia political science professor. \\\"(Singh) may have been handed the gift of some voters as a result of all this,\\\" he said. \\\"Although it's just one thing amongst many, boy, he could use a win right now.\\\" Singh has faced criticism for poor fundraising and low poll numbers. Burnaby South occupies historically strong NDP territory, so if Singh can't win in the riding, it adds to the interpretation that he hasn't secured the support of party loyalists, said Johnston. The NDP beat the Liberals by just over 500 votes in the riding in 2015, but Johnston said he never expected the Liberals to do as well this time in Burnaby South. \\\"That was kind of a high point and their support might drop even further,\\\" he said. Lee said local issues, especially affordable housing, are more important to Burnaby South voters than the situation in Ottawa. He has touted the Liberal government's national housing strategy, which promises $40 billion over 10 years, while Conservative candidate Jay Shin has called for lower taxes and job-creation measures to help residents earn and save more money. Singh has unveiled a plan to build 500,000 affordable homes across Canada. He challenged Trudeau to eliminate the GST for developers building affordable homes, subsidize low-income renters and double the first-time homebuyers' tax credit. Byelections will also take place in York-Simcoe in Ontario and Outremont in Montreal on Monday. The results might provide insight into whether Quebec MP Maxime Bernier's new right-wing People's Party of Canada can snatch votes from the Conservatives. A recent debate in Burnaby South became heated when People's Party candidate Laura-Lynn Tyler Thompson discussed immigration. An online video of the debate shows Singh urging audience members to recognize they are all immigrants, unless they are Indigenous. When Tyler Thompson raises the murder of Burnaby teen Marrisa Shen \\u2014 in which a Syrian national has been charged \\u2014 to argue for more careful vetting of refugees, an audience member yells: \\\"That is racist! Shame on you!\\\" \\\"It's not racist to have safety,\\\" replies Tyler Thompson. Shin, the Conservative candidate, recently distributed flyers taking aim at Tyler Thompson, accusing her of supporting supervised injection sites and the legalization of marijuana, which she described as a \\\"smear campaign\\\" based on \\\"lies.\\\" However, Shin said he isn't worried about Tyler Thompson and doesn't think her message is resonating. \\\"When I speak with voters at the doors, I don't get a sense of that at all,\\\" he said. Tyler Thompson, a former Christian TV show host who opposes abortion and has protested teaching resources that educate kids about gay and transgender identities, said she believes the Conservatives are threatened by the People's Party. \\\"My message is resonating with Canadians because they like my strong stance for family.\\\" \"\n",

If they seek medical attention, they should call their doctor&rsquo;s office first to avoid exposing other people, she added.Padhi said immunization in the Fraser Health region has improved this year, with public-health units administering 5,768 MMR vaccines since mid-February this year, compared with 2,882 of the vaccines during the same period in 2018.Two cases of measles were reported by Island Health on March 29 and Interior Health issued two bulletins about possible public exposures in the area of 100 Mile House on March 9 and 22, according to the B.C. Centre for Disease Control. Another case was confirmed in the Fraser Valley earlier in March.Twelve of the 15 cases in Vancouver have been directly linked to an outbreak that began at \\u00c9cole Secondaire Jules-Verne and \\u00c9cole Rose-Des-Vents, after a student contracted the disease during an overseas family trip. The remaining three cases were acquired while travelling, but not linked to the school outbreak.Last month, Health Minister Adrian Dix announced $3 million in additional funding for the measles vaccine and a campaign to encourage immunization through the schools, health authorities and media.Is there more to this story?

PROVINCE      Share  Adjust  Comment  Print  The Saskatchewan Health Authority has confirmed a case of measles in Yorkton and is alerting those who may have been exposed to the highly infectious disease.The measles case was confirmed in a returning traveller who had flown into the Regina International Airport on June 9 after overseas travel.The passenger with measles boarded Air China Limited flight CA 0948 departing from Delhi\\u2019s Indira Gandhi International Airport (DEL) at 2:50 a.m. and arrived at Beijing Capital International Airport (PEK) at 11:25 a.m. The passenger was at PEK until boarding Air China Limited flight CA 0991 at 3:25 p.m., which arrived at Vancouver International Airport (YVR) at 10:50 a.m. The SHA issued an exposure alert for people on those flights and anyone in Vancouver\\u2019s main airport terminal at approximately 10:50 a.m., with the path of travel through Canada Customs and Immigration shortly after.The passenger with measles then departed YVR on Air Canada flight AC 8572 at 2 p.m., arriving at Regina International Airport (YQR) at 5 p.m. The SHA is also issuing an exposure alert for those who were at YQR\\u2019s arrivals and baggage area between 5 and 8 p.m.People who were at the Yorkton Regional Health Centre between 8 p.m. June 9 and 3:40 a.m. June 10 may also have been exposed to measles.\\u201cIf you have been on any of these flights or in the airport or in the Yorkton Regional Health Centre during the times above, and are pregnant, immunosuppressed or under the age of one, you may qualify for preventative treatment,\\u201d the SHA said in its alert.\\u201cPassengers, crew, travellers and area residents who may have come into contact with measles as above, and are unsure of their immunization against measles, are asked to contact their local Public Health Office.\\u201dWhile it is expected that the majority of travellers will be immune to measles, which is transmitted by airborne spread, some people may be susceptible, including infants less than one year old, immunosuppressed people or those who have never been immunized against measles.Individuals born after 1970 should have received two doses of a measles vaccine (often given as combined measles, mumps and rubella vaccine, or MMR) to be protected. Those who were born prior to 1970 are likely to be immune due to prior measles infection.Infected individuals are likely to develop symptoms within 7 to 21 days of being exposed. Symptoms of measles include fever, cough, runny nose, red eyes and a rash that starts centrally (including on the face), spreads to the limbs and lasts at leas three days.If you develop any of these symptoms of measles and suspect you may have measles, call ahead to your health care provider, and inform them that you may have been exposed to measles, so that she/he will arrange to see you in a manner that avoids infecting others in the waiting room.If you live in the\\u00a0Yorkton or surrounding area, please call\\u00a01-866-343-1460.If you live in Regina or surrounding area, please call 306-766-7790.In Saskatchewan, for general inquiries regarding measles, please contact HealthLine at 811.If you reside elsewhere, please call your local Public Health Office.

Vancouver-area measles outbreak: Where you might have been exposed Infectious people were at Costco, the airport, a Blazers game and other sites. Here's what you need to know.The outbreak has started to extend outside the Vancouver area. One man who traveled to Clark County was diagnosed with measles. In Oregon, one case was discovered in Multnomah County . It\\u2019s not yet clear where the person lives.Two people were quarantined during a visit to Hawaii when doctors realized they had been exposed to measles in Clark County and developed the associated rash during the trip.Washington Gov. Jay Inslee declared a state of emergency due to the outbreak on Friday , three days after officials in Clark County declared a public health emergency .The highly contagious virus spreads through the air and can linger for up to two hours in an isolated space. People who have never received a measles vaccine are susceptible to the disease, which can be deadly.State public health officials are urging people who have not received the vaccine to get it now -- as well as people who received the first dose but never the second, both of which are recommended in the first 10 years of life.The measles vaccine is 97 percent effective, and can reduce the risk of infection if gotten within 72 hours after exposure to the virus.Clark County health officials are keeping both students and staff who cannot prove they have been vaccinated from the schools linked to the outbreak, most of which are in the Evergreen School District. Those who are excluded are also not supposed to enter other schools, child care centers or places with lots of people.Even friends and families of students and staff at Evergreen High School and Orchards, Hearthwood and Image elementary schools are asked not to attend any events or games at the schools unless immunized. The Clark County health department has placed this restriction until Jan. 30 for most schools and Feb. 5 for Orchards.To further limit the spread of the virus, health officials ask that people who think they might have measles call their doctor or health care provider before visiting a hospital or doctor\\u2019s office.Washington State Department of Health keeps track of residents\\u2019 immunization status so people can see if they need shots.Clark County Public Health also now maintains a daily call center for questions about the outbreak at 360-397-8021.-- Molly Harbargermharbarger@oregonian.com 503-294-5923 @MollyHarbarger Visit subscription.oregonlive.com/newsletters to get Oregonian/OregonLive journalism delivered to your email inbox.\"\n",

Symptoms include fever, sore eyes and a cough, followed by a red, blotchy rash covering the head and body.This is the ninth measles alert from NSW Health this year.Authorities say the risk of measles being brought to Australia is high, due to outbreaks of measles in popular holiday destinations overseas.Travellers are urged to consider being vaccinated before travelling to south and south-east Asia where the disease is prevalent.Property  THEY\\u2019RE jawdropping, dripping in luxurious features and have sold for more money than most people can dream of.

Passengers, crew and travelers who may have come into contact with this case of measles are asked to be aware of this potential exposure should they develop symptoms compatible with measles.Most travellers will be immune to measles due to prior immunization, with older travellers immune from having had measles as a child, according to health officials.Those most likely to develop measles after exposure are infants less than one year old who have not been vaccinated, or others who have never been immunized against measles.If you become ill and suspect you may have measles from this or another exposure such as traveling overseas to the many parts of the world where measles occurs frequently, call your doctor and inform them that you may have measles, so that they can arrange to see you in a manner that avoids infecting others in the waiting room.You can also call your local health unit and ask for the communicable disease nurse.To find a public health unit anywhere in the province, use the locator on ImmunizeBC.caSymptoms of measles include:FeverCough Runny noseRed eyesRash that starts centrally including on the face, spreads to the limbs and lasts at least three daysNon-immune exposed individuals can become infected by being in the same airspace as a measles case. If infected, they will develop symptoms within 7 to 21 days of being exposed.Those who are concerned about their potential measles exposure but have no symptoms can call 8-1-1 and speak to a nurse.Individuals most at risk from measles are those who are completely unvaccinated against the disease including babies under one year of age. Individuals born after 1970 should have received two doses of a measles vaccine (often given as combined measles, mumps and rubella vaccine, or MMR) to be protected.Those who were born prior to 1970 are likely to be immune due to prior measles infection.The BCCDC advises British Columbians to review their immunization status prior to travel. Measles has been on the rise for several years worldwide including several countries in Europe and Southeast Asia, which are common travel destinations for British Columbians.The best time to protect yourself, officials add, is before you travel.\"\n",

The measles outbreak in Clark County that has racked up 23 confirmed cases since Jan. 1 isn&#8217;t likely to go away or slow down any time soon, even though no new cases or exposure locations were confirmed today.There are seven suspected measles cases, according to a Clark County Public Health news release.Officials are also\\u00a0investigating a suspected case of the measles in King County.\\u00a0Public Health Seattle &amp; King County said Wednesday that the man in his 50s was hospitalized but has been released.\\u00a0Officials say the man had recently traveled to Vancouver, but it\\u2019s not clear if that\\u2019s where he was infected.Officials say results from additional testing to confirm the case are expected by the end of the week.At Wednesday morning&#8217;s Clark County Board of Health meeting, Clark County Public Health Officer Dr. Alan Melnick informed the Clark County Council that the measles outbreak could last months, spread into other Washington counties, south to Oregon and possibly cost Clark County hundreds of thousands of dollars.Melnick said the first several days of the outbreak response effort cost somewhere around $31,000.\\u201cThis is going to be likely, hundreds of thousands of dollars if not more,&#8221; Melnick told the council. &#8220;This is going to be pretty expensive.\\u201dIt&#8217;s even possible the outbreak could be declared a statewide emergency, after being declared a Clark County health emergency by the council last week. A statewide declaration would most likely happen if the outbreak continues to increase in numbers, and reaches other counties, Melnick said.\\u201cIt\\u2019s very possible that we\\u2019ll be seeing cases outside of Clark County, including other spots in Washington as well as to our neighbors to the south,&#8221; Melnick said.The time from when you get exposed to measles to when you develop symptoms and become contagious ranges from seven to 21 days, Melnick said.\\u00a0Melnick said the outbreak is reaching the third or fourth generation now, meaning the outbreak starts with a case that then infects secondary cases, and then those cases infect new people and it starts multiplying and creating new generations.&#8220;We\\u2019re getting into the third and fourth generation and as you can imagine the numbers can increase,&#8221; he told the council. &#8220;I\\u2019m hoping some of the measures we\\u2019ve taken can reduce that. But there\\u2019s a good possibility well be dealing with measles in continuing numbers and perhaps even increasing numbers in the next few weeks and months.\\u201dA statewide emergency means that federal resources can be tapped. Melnick said Clark County Public Health is being stretched somewhat thin by the outbreak. Public Health is having to pull staff from other departments to help assist in the response.Some food inspectors have shifted over in the response effort, which means they&#8217;re not only leaving their main duties, but also leaving a role (food inspection) that collects fees for the county.\\u201cThis basically impacts everything that we do,&#8221; Melnick said. &#8220;But we are faced with this potentially deadly outbreak here and it\\u2019s a matter of prioritizing our resources and it\\u2019s kind of all hands on deck right now.\\u201dCouncil Chair Eileen Quiring discussed with Melnick the reasons for Clark County&#8217;s low vaccination rates, which Melnick said were low for Washington and the U.S.\\u201cIn the 25 years that I\\u2019ve known about immunizations and the controversy over it, there are things on the web and there are organizations that say that vaccinations cause autism and that\\u2019s why some parents are reluctant to have their children vaccinated,\\u201d\\u00a0Quiring said.Quiring explained that sometimes when people say something over and over and over again, others can perceive it as truth, even if it isn&#8217;t.Melnick noted Public Health is not only fighting an outbreak, but also a campaign against false information that appears frequently online.\\u201cUnfortunately there\\u2019s a lot of misinformation going around on social networks and some of it is very sophisticated looking and very well done,&#8221; Melnick said. &#8220;The link between vaccination and autism has been debunked a long time ago. There\\u2019s also misinformation going on about shedding the vaccine virus and causing other people to get infected. That\\u2019s also been debunked, but it\\u2019s very believable. I think that\\u2019s difficult for parents, because they look at this stuff and it seems very legitimate. But it\\u2019s not true. That\\u2019s what we\\u2019re up against.\\u201dMelnick explained the low rates for vaccination mostly stemmed from people requesting personal and philosophical exemptions. He said that religious exemptions are rare, as are health-related exemptions.That&#8217;s been curbed some recently because in the last couple years legislation was passed that required parents to meet with a medical provider to discuss vaccines and personal exemptions. Regardless, Melnick said Clark County&#8217;s vaccination rates are too low.At the 11 schools for which immunization data was available, 678 of 6,958 students were listed as being exempt from receiving their measles, mumps and rubella vaccines during the 2017-2018 school year.According to the Washington State Department of Health, Battle Ground Public School\\u2019s River HomeLink has the highest rate of students who do not have MMR shots. Of the 1,019 students enrolled at the school, 239, or 23.5 percent, are not immunized against the highly contagious virus.Data was not available for Slavic Christian Academy, a private school located in Orchards.Clark County Public Health is requiring exclusion of students and staff without documented immunity to measles from only schools identified as possible exposure sites. Students and staff excluded from those identified schools are also excluded from other schools, child care and other congregate settings.Students and staff at schools where measles exposure did not occur are not impacted by exclusions.Melnick said it would be tragic for a child to die because of the outbreak, and mentioned that if everyone was vaccinated, measles could be eliminated. He also explained that about 400 to 500 people died per year from measles before the vaccine.Council member Julie Olson, who represents District 2, wished that people would take the disease more seriously.\\u201cThis a preventable disease,&#8221; Olson said. &#8220;The idea that it is not dangerous is just wrong. That we allow our children to be exposed to this kind of illness and put them through this kind of suffering is unconscionable.\\u201dThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports that 90 percent of unvaccinated people exposed to the measles virus develop the disease. The virus lives in the nose and throat mucus of an infected person, and can survive for up to two hours in an airspace where the infected person coughed or sneezed.Health officials are urging anyone who has been exposed at an identified location and believes they have symptoms of measles to call their health care provider prior to visiting the medical office to make a plan that avoids exposing others in the waiting room.If you are unsure of your family\\u2019s immunization status, you can view, download and print your family\\u2019s immunization information online at MyIR.net or request a copy of your immunization record from the Washington State Department of Health.Anyone with questions about measles infection or the measles vaccine should call their primary care provider or a county health department:\\u2022\\u00a0Clark County Public Health, 360-397-8021\\u2022\\u00a0Multnomah County Public Health, 503-988-3406\\u2022\\u00a0Washington County Public Health, 503-846-3594\\u2022\\u00a0Clackamas County Public Health, 503-655-8411Public Health has identified additional locations where people may have been exposed to measles.

Dr Alistair Humphrey, Canterbury Medical Officer of Health, says any passenger or crew member who is not fully protected from measles should quarantine themselves for the next week, even if they have no symptoms. This means staying home from school or work and having no contact with unimmunised people for seven to 14 days after the flight. \\\"They can return to work if they are not unwell on Wednesday 3 April 2019,\\\" he says. People are considered fully protected from measles if they:   Have had two doses of the MMR vaccine  Have had clinically confirmed measles  Were born before 1969  \\\"If you were on this flight and aren't fully immunised against measles, you should also call anyone you have been in the same room with today to let them know that they too have been exposed to measles,\\\" Dr Humphrey says. \\\"This new secondary set of contacts will need to remain isolated for 14 days unless they are fully immunised.\\\" Anyone with these symptoms in the next week should call their doctor:   Respiratory-type illness with dry cough, runny nose, headache  Temperature over 38.5degC, feeling very unwell  A red blotchy rash on day four or five of the illness, usually beginning on the face and moving to chest and arms  People at risk from contracting measles should avoid going to their general practice or hospital except when advised by a healthcare professional or in cases of emergency.

As with the previous case, OPH provided no details on age, gender or travel itinerary of the latest patient.\\u00a0OPH said it was working closely with health-care providers and hospitals to contact individuals and families who might have been exposed to the most recently identified infectious case.

The first vaccine, which is given to children around the age of one, offers 85- to 95-per-cent protection against the infectious disease. The booster vaccine, given to children between the ages of four and six, offers almost 100-per-cent protection.People who believed they were exposed should check their immunization status or call their health-care provider. Anyone who feels ill should isolate themselves and if in need of a medical appointment should call ahead to their provider can take precautions to protect other patients.OPH stressed that people would not go to a hospital to receive the measles vaccine but should instead contact their health-care provider.Doctors have been asked to be on alert for cases of measles in the city this year as outbreaks of measles expand in parts of Canada and around the world. In the U.S., there have been more reported cases of measles in the first three months of 2019 than in all of last year due to falling vaccination rates and vaccine hesitancy.The cases revealed in Ottawa this month are the first in the city since 2016.\\u00a0 \\u00a0         Comments  Share your thoughts           \"\n",

Anyone who may have been at the airport between 5 p.m. on May 29 3:30 p.m. on\\u00a0May 30 could have been\\u00a0exposed and could develop symptoms of the disease by June 20.\\u00a0    New Jersey residents who could have been exposed on the same flights will be notified by their local health departments. nyone who thinks they may have been exposed should call a doctor before going to a doctor's office or emergency room so they can protect other patients and staff.    Dr. Christina Tan, the state epidemiologist, said two doses of the measles vaccine is effective in preventing the disease. Symptoms of measles include a rash, high fever, cough, runny nose and red,\\u00a0watery eyes. It is easily spread through the air by coughs and sneezes and can be spread through mucus or saliva.    This is at least the fifth\\u00a0potential exposure at Newark Airport since October. There have been measles outbreaks in recent months in Rockland County, New York and in Ocean County, New Jersey.\\u00a0The outbreak in Rockland County began when seven travelers from Israel visited last October.

Corrections Deputy National Commissioner, Andy Milne, said a prisoner and a staff member at Mt Eden Corrections Facility had measles and a prisoner at Serco-operated Auckland South Corrections Facility was currently unwell with the disease.He said immediate action was taken to isolate unwell prisoners and reduce the risk of any infection spreading.Mr Milne said there were currently no confirmed cases at any other Corrections' prisons in Auckland or nationwide. Meanwhile, a passenger with measles has travelled on a flight from Melbourne to Auckland this week, potentially affecting others on board.The person departed Melbourne for Auckland on Jetstar flight JQ217 at 11.45pm on 8 September and arrived in Auckland at 5.20am on 9 September.Public health authorities said anyone who was on the flight should watch out for the symptoms of measles.The disease spreads easily through the air through coughing and sneezing.The Auckland Regional Public Health service said the person did not know they had measles at the time.The number of measles cases in Auckland climbed to 1028 on Friday. Nationwide, there have been 1172 cases.Health officials said the steady and unchanging rate of increase showed the disease has not yet peaked.However, large numbers of people are now being vaccinated - up to 2000 a day.The Auckland Regional Public Health service said it may take a fortnight to see the impact from the increase in vaccinations on the number of measles cases.In Canterbury, an infant has been confirmed as having measles.It is believed the child contracted measles in Auckland before its family returned to Christchurch.The Canterbury District Health Board said the infant had not yet received their first dose of the MMR vaccine, which is usually given at 15 months.The Medical Officer of Health, Alistair Humphrey, said the message from the Ministry of Health was clear - that people should not travel to Auckland if they are not fully vaccinated.\"\n",

While there is no treatment for measles, it can be prevented through immunization.\\u201cIndividuals who were exposed between May 9-17 are no longer eligible for preventative vaccine as the vaccine would not be effective to prevent measles from this exposure,\\u201d the advisory states.They were still encouraged to review their immunization history and arrange vaccination if they have yet to receive two doses of the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine.The potential exposures occurred: May 9 between 3 p.m. and 5:45 p.m. at Sherwood Park Mall May 10, also between 3 p.m. and 5:45 p.m. at Sherwood Park Mall. May 11 at Sherwood Park Mall between 2 p.m. and 4:30 p.m., as well as Smilie\\u2019s Village restaurant in Sherwood Park between 6 and 10 p.m. May 15 at Shoppers Drug Mart, 2020 Sherwood Drive, between 9 p.m. and 11:30 p.m. May 16 between 4 p.m. and 6 p.m. at Carmack\\u2019s Construction in Nisku, as well as the Strathcona County Health Centre emergency department between 8 p.m. May 16 and 5:30 p.m. May 17.

The individual flew on two China Southern flights on June 23 and 24 traveling from New Delhi to Vancouver, changing plans in Guangzhou.  \\u201cTravellers on one or both of these flights, as well as those in proximity to the case who travelled through YVR on Saturday, June 23 may have been exposed,\\u201d the BCCDC said in a statement. \\u201cSome potentially exposed passengers or flight crew may have been travelling to other destinations including within Canada.\\u201d The infectious individual was on China Southern flight CZ 3028 departing New Delhi on June 23 at 11:55 a.m. and arriving in Guangzhou at 7:40 p.m. The person then flew on China Southern flight CZ 377 departing Guangzhou on June 24 at 12:50 a.m. and landing in Vancouver on June 23 at 9:30 p.m. \\u201cMeasles is a highly infectious disease transmitted by airborne spread,\\u201d the CDC said. \\u201cTravellers on one or both of these flights are asked to check their immunization status.\\u201d It is expected that most travelers will be immune to the disease, however some individuals might be more susceptible, including children less than a year old or people who have never been immunized. The incubation period (the time it takes to develop symptoms after being exposed) for measles ranges from seven to 21 days, so a traveller infected with measles on either flight would expect to develop symptoms by about July 15. Symptoms include: fever, cough, runny nose, red eyes and a rash that starts centrally, including on the face, spreads to the limbs and lasts at least three days. \\u201cMeasles can be a serious infection and is very infectious to others,\\u201d the CDC said. \\u201cIf you become ill with any of the above symptoms and suspect you may have measles, call your doctor and inform them that you may have been exposed to measles, so that s/he will arrange to see you in a manner that avoids infecting others in the waiting room.\\u201d Anyone concerned about potential exposure to measles but have no symptoms can call 811 and speak to a nurse. @JessicaEKerr \"\n",

Vancouver Coastal Health said the two new cases are not related to the outbreak involving two French language schools. The health authority said the two people were infected while they were travelling, but has only specified that one of them went to the Philippines. A spokesperson with the Ministry of Health confirmed to CTV News the second person had also travelled to the island nation.  VCH said the first measles patient arrived at the YVR on Feb. 11 on Philippine Airlines flight PR 116 from Manila and had a one-night layover. The patient left Vancouver to Edmonton on Air Canada Flight AC236 on Feb. 12. \\\"The safety and security of our passengers, employees and community is our top priority. We recommend anyone who was on the flights or in the terminal at YVR on those days and may be experiencing symptoms to contact 811 to talk to a nurse,\\\" YVR spokesperson Chris Devauld said in an e-mail. The second measles patient is a resident of the Lower Mainland and was infectious when they went to a restaurant and mall in Richmond, according to the health authority. VCH identified several places where people may have been exposed to the highly contagious virus, including: YVR, international arrivals and customs area between 4 and 7 p.m. on Feb. 11 Shuttle bus from YVR to La Quinta Inn in Richmond between 5 to 7 p.m. on Feb. 11 Shuttle bus from YVR to La Quinta Inn in Richmond between 8 and 10:30 a.m. on Feb. 12 YVR, Air Canada domestic departures area between 9 a.m. and noon on Feb. 12 Little Onpin Restaurant in Richmond between 6 and 10 p.m. on Feb. 16 Toys R Us at Lansdowne Centre between 11 a.m. and 9 p.m. on Feb. 17 Toys R Us at Lansdowne Centre between 11 a.m. and 9 p.m. on Feb. 18 'We can do better'  Health officials said those who have never had the measles or did not have the two doses of the vaccine are at the highest risk of contracting the virus. They encourage people to get fully immunized, adding the shot is free for everyone. Health Minister Adrian Dix assures all British Columbians that there is enough vaccine to deal with the demand. \\\"Frankly, people shouldn't be getting measles in the 21st century in British Columbia,\\\" he said. \\\"While our healthcare system is doing very well, I think can we do better and we will do better.\\\" Health Minister Dix says BC is in communications with other provinces and Washington State about the measles outbreak. Says 12 cases is too many and again implores people to get vaccinated @CTVVancouverpic.twitter.com/c1NjsbpeNi Other cases linked to French schools  On Friday, Vancouver Coastal Health announced there was a total of 10 cases that were \\\"very clearly associated\\\" with the schools, Ecole Secondaire Jules-Verne and Ecole Rose-Des-Vents. Officials said 33 students at the two schools have been ordered to stay home because they haven't provided proof of measles vaccination.  The other three cases were contracted while travelling and one unrelated case was acquired locally, according to VCH. Health officials are reminding people they can get vaccinations by visiting their family doctor, a walk-in clinic or urgent primary care centre, or a pharmacy for adults or children over five years old. Calling ahead is also recommended.\"\n",

Paradoxically, she said the success of immunization programs over time means many people have never encountered vaccine-preventable diseases. \\u201cBecause of this, the risk associated with them, the consequences of such infections are not known to people and so there may be less of an urgency paid to immunizations. \\u201cPeople who were exposed in the previous exposure may not all have developed symptoms, so we may get additional cases,\\u201d she said, adding that does not mean the outbreak is continuing.  Although there is enough MMR vaccine #BC -wide, some pharmacies have run out. \\\"There is absolutely an increased demand in vaccines,\\\" @VCHhealthcare Dr. R\\u00e9ka Gustafson says.

Paradoxically, she said the success of immunization programs over time means many people have never encountered vaccine-preventable diseases. \\u201cBecause of this, the risk associated with them, the consequences of such infections are not known to people and so there may be less of an urgency paid to immunizations. \\u201cPeople who were exposed in the previous exposure may not all have developed symptoms, so we may get additional cases,\\u201d she said, adding that does not mean the outbreak is continuing.  Although there is enough MMR vaccine #BC -wide, some pharmacies have run out. \\\"There is absolutely an increased demand in vaccines,\\\" @VCHhealthcare Dr. R\\u00e9ka Gustafson says. Reminds all that most effective way to stop measles is to get the vaccine. @BlackPressMedia \\u2014 Kat Slepian (@katslepian) February 25, 2019 The best defence against the measles, Gustafson said, is to make sure you and your family have both doses of the measles, mumps and rubella vaccines.

Those who were born prior to 1970 are likely to be immune due to prior measles infection.Infected individuals are likely to develop symptoms within 7 to 21 days of being exposed. Symptoms of measles include fever, cough, runny nose, red eyes and a rash that starts centrally (including on the face), spreads to the limbs and lasts at leas three days.If you develop any of these symptoms of measles and suspect you may have measles, call ahead to your health care provider, and inform them that you may have been exposed to measles, so that she/he will arrange to see you in a manner that avoids infecting others in the waiting room.If you live in the\\u00a0Yorkton or surrounding area, please call\\u00a01-866-343-1460.If you live in Regina or surrounding area, please call 306-766-7790.In Saskatchewan, for general inquiries regarding measles, please contact HealthLine at 811.If you reside elsewhere, please call your local Public Health Office.

A medical health officer in Vancouver says measles is not expected to spread beyond a cluster of patients, but anyone travelling to other parts of the world should ensure they are vaccinated against the contagious disease. Dr. Reka Gustafson of Vancouver Coastal Health says people often go to a travel clinic before a trip to get protection against diseases that don't circulate locally and it's a good opportunity to ensure all childhood vaccinations are up to date. She says most people in B.C. are vaccinated and older adults may already have had measles but anyone born after 1970 should ensure they have two doses of a vaccine, which is routinely given to children at age one and then between the ages of four and six. Two new cases were reported in the province Sunday, bringing the total to 13, with most of them linked to two French-language schools after an unvaccinated child contracted the disease during a trip to Vietnam. Gustafson says it took a week to get all the students' immunization records and improvements are needed to ensure a quicker system limits disruption to families as well as use of health-care resources. Symptoms of measles include a runny nose, cough, fever, red, itchy eyes and sometimes a rash, and Gustafson says parents who suspect their child has the disease should call their doctor's office in advance in order to get a separate room. Meanwhile, CTV News reports one of the recently reported cases involved an employee at a Richmond Toys \\\"R\\\" Us store. Notices have been posted at the Lansdowne Centre outlet, warning shoppers they may have been exposed on Feb. 17 and 18. \\u2013 with files from CTV Vancouver  \"\n",

      "   \"content_t\": \"A new case of measles has been confirmed on southern Vancouver Island a week after Island Health said two people who travelled abroad had been infected with the highly contagious disease. Island Health says it's now alerting people who may have been exposed to the latest measles patient at two locations on the Saanich Peninsula. The first exposure may have occurred between noon and 3 p.m. on March 30 at the Beacon Community Services Thrift Store on West Saanich Road. Another exposure may have occurred during the same time frame at Fairway Market on West Saanich Road. Anyone who was at either location during the specified times and has not been immunized for measles is advised to call the Saanich Health Unit to find out where to get vaccinated. Those exposed to measles who have been experiencing symptoms like fever, runny nose, sore throat, cough, diarrhea and red eyes followed by a rash that begins on the face and spreads to the chest are asked to contact their health care provider. According to experts, if a person is exposed to an infectious measles carrier they would show symptoms anywhere from 10 days to three weeks after the contact. It comes after two measles infections were confirmed on Vancouver Island in March. Both patients caught the measles while travelling in Vietnam, and have since made full recoveries. Island Health says the window of infection for those cases has closed, and the latest case does not appear to be linked. The outbreak has put a spotlight on the so-called anti-vaxxer movement and prompted the province to move ahead with a plan to have all students provide proof of immunization in B.C. schools. Island Health says in the last five weeks doctors have administered 3,474 measles vaccinations, more than double the number from 2018. The authority says two doses of measles vaccine is 99 per cent effective at preventing the disease. Island Health says anyone who wants to learn more about immunization services in their area can call a local information line:   South Island: 250-544-7676 ext. 27545  Nanaimo/Ladysmith/Gabriola: 250-755-3388  Courtenay/Comox Valley: 250-331-8599  Campbell River and area: 250-850-2120  Mt.

Passengers, crew and travelers who may have come into contact with this case of measles are asked to be aware of this potential exposure should they develop symptoms compatible with measles.Most travellers will be immune to measles due to prior immunization, with older travellers immune from having had measles as a child, according to health officials.Those most likely to develop measles after exposure are infants less than one year old who have not been vaccinated, or others who have never been immunized against measles.If you become ill and suspect you may have measles from this or another exposure such as traveling overseas to the many parts of the world where measles occurs frequently, call your doctor and inform them that you may have measles, so that they can arrange to see you in a manner that avoids infecting others in the waiting room.You can also call your local health unit and ask for the communicable disease nurse.To find a public health unit anywhere in the province, use the locator on ImmunizeBC.caSymptoms of measles include:FeverCough Runny noseRed eyesRash that starts centrally including on the face, spreads to the limbs and lasts at least three daysNon-immune exposed individuals can become infected by being in the same airspace as a measles case. If infected, they will develop symptoms within 7 to 21 days of being exposed.Those who are concerned about their potential measles exposure but have no symptoms can call 8-1-1 and speak to a nurse.Individuals most at risk from measles are those who are completely unvaccinated against the disease including babies under one year of age. Individuals born after 1970 should have received two doses of a measles vaccine (often given as combined measles, mumps and rubella vaccine, or MMR) to be protected.Those who were born prior to 1970 are likely to be immune due to prior measles infection.The BCCDC advises British Columbians to review their immunization status prior to travel. Measles has been on the rise for several years worldwide including several countries in Europe and Southeast Asia, which are common travel destinations for British Columbians.The best time to protect yourself, officials add, is before you travel.\"\n",

The stakes are high for NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh in a Metro Vancouver byelection race, but an expert says recent Liberal turmoil has been a \\\"gift\\\" to his campaign. The 40-year-old former Ontario legislator has lacked a voice in Parliament since becoming party leader in the fall of 2017. Now he finally has his chance in Burnaby South as voters in the riding cast their ballots on Monday after a six-week race. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Darryl Dyck   The stakes are high for NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh in a Metro Vancouver byelection race, but an expert says recent Liberal turmoil has been a \\\"gift\\\" to his campaign. The 40-year-old former Ontario legislator has lacked a voice in Parliament since becoming party leader in the fall of 2017. Now he finally has his chance in Burnaby South as voters in the riding cast their ballots on Monday after a six-week race. The Liberals got off to a rocky start when their first candidate, Karen Wang, resigned after pointing out Singh's ethnicity online. In recent weeks, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has been besieged by allegations his office pressured former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould to stop a criminal prosecution of SNC-Lavalin. Singh said he's not taking anything for granted but he's confident his hard work to connect with voters will pay off. \\\"I think people are very disappointed with what's going on with the Liberal government,\\\" he said. \\\"Canadians expect our government works in our interest. It looks more and more like this government and Mr. Trudeau and the Liberal party are working in the interest of a massive multinational corporation.\\\" Trudeau has denied he or his office directed Wilson-Raybould on the matter. Michael Wernick, clerk of the Privy Council, recently said Trudeau repeatedly assured Wilson-Raybould a decision on the prosecution was hers alone to make. Richard T. Lee, the Liberal candidate who replaced Wang in Burnaby South, said few people are raising the issue on the doorstep. \\\"I understand some people are concerned about that, but the office of the prime minister and the prime minister himself have made a statement already,\\\" he said. Byelections typically have low turnouts, but there is evidence the results of them are driven by the popularity of the government and its leader, said Richard Johnston, a University of British Columbia political science professor. \\\"(Singh) may have been handed the gift of some voters as a result of all this,\\\" he said. \\\"Although it's just one thing amongst many, boy, he could use a win right now.\\\" Singh has faced criticism for poor fundraising and low poll numbers. Burnaby South occupies historically strong NDP territory, so if Singh can't win in the riding, it adds to the interpretation that he hasn't secured the support of party loyalists, said Johnston. The NDP beat the Liberals by just over 500 votes in the riding in 2015, but Johnston said he never expected the Liberals to do as well this time in Burnaby South. \\\"That was kind of a high point and their support might drop even further,\\\" he said. Lee said local issues, especially affordable housing, are more important to Burnaby South voters than the situation in Ottawa. He has touted the Liberal government's national housing strategy, which promises $40 billion over 10 years, while Conservative candidate Jay Shin has called for lower taxes and job-creation measures to help residents earn and save more money. Singh has unveiled a plan to build 500,000 affordable homes across Canada. He challenged Trudeau to eliminate the GST for developers building affordable homes, subsidize low-income renters and double the first-time homebuyers' tax credit. Byelections will also take place in York-Simcoe in Ontario and Outremont in Montreal on Monday. The results might provide insight into whether Quebec MP Maxime Bernier's new right-wing People's Party of Canada can snatch votes from the Conservatives. A recent debate in Burnaby South became heated when People's Party candidate Laura-Lynn Tyler Thompson discussed immigration. An online video of the debate shows Singh urging audience members to recognize they are all immigrants, unless they are Indigenous. When Tyler Thompson raises the murder of Burnaby teen Marrisa Shen \\u2014 in which a Syrian national has been charged \\u2014 to argue for more careful vetting of refugees, an audience member yells: \\\"That is racist! Shame on you!\\\" \\\"It's not racist to have safety,\\\" replies Tyler Thompson. Shin, the Conservative candidate, recently distributed flyers taking aim at Tyler Thompson, accusing her of supporting supervised injection sites and the legalization of marijuana, which she described as a \\\"smear campaign\\\" based on \\\"lies.\\\" However, Shin said he isn't worried about Tyler Thompson and doesn't think her message is resonating. \\\"When I speak with voters at the doors, I don't get a sense of that at all,\\\" he said. Tyler Thompson, a former Christian TV show host who opposes abortion and has protested teaching resources that educate kids about gay and transgender identities, said she believes the Conservatives are threatened by the People's Party. \\\"My message is resonating with Canadians because they like my strong stance for family.\\\" \"\n",

He says vaccination rates could be higher and anyone who needs more information should contact their local health authority.

The individual was there between 9-10 a.m.Those who suspect they came into contact with this person should monitor themselves for measles symptoms for 21 days, the statement said. Measles is a highly contagious respiratory infection that is transferred to other persons through airborne droplets spread through coughing and sneezing. These droplets may remain in the air for up to two hours after an infected person has left an area, the news statement said. Anyone exhibiting signs of measles should contact a health care provider immediately, the statement said. Symptoms include a red rash that starts as spots on the face and moves down the body, a fever over 101 degrees, a cough, runny nose and irritated eyes. Collin County is encouraging those who suspect they are infected with measles to call and inform their health care providers before arriving for treatment so that arrangements can be made to prevent further spread of the disease, the statement said. In the statement, Dr. Jawaid Asghar, Collin County Health Care Services\\u2019 chief epidemiologist, said residents should talk with their doctors about the benefits of immunization and get vaccinated if eligible.

Dr. Reka Gustafson of Vancouver Coastal Health says people often go to a travel clinic before a trip to get protection against diseases that don't circulate locally and it's a good opportunity to ensure all childhood vaccinations are up to date. She says most people in B.C. are vaccinated and older adults may already have had measles but anyone born after 1970 should ensure they have two doses of a vaccine, which is routinely given to children at age one and then between the ages of four and six. Two new cases were reported in the province Sunday, bringing the total to 13, with most of them linked to two French-language schools after an unvaccinated child contracted the disease during a trip to Vietnam. Gustafson says it took a week to get all the students' immunization records and improvements are needed to ensure a quicker system limits disruption to families as well as use of health-care resources. Symptoms of measles include a runny nose, cough, fever, red, itchy eyes and sometimes a rash, and Gustafson says parents who suspect their child has the disease should call their doctor's office in advance in order to get a separate room.\"\n",

      "   \"content_t\": \"Social media in the Cowichan Valley was buzzing early this week with the story of an alleged case of measles in the area, however, tests have now concluded the child doesn\\u2019t have measles. Some comments on Facebook were speculating that a local child had been infected with measles while visiting Vancouver recently, where numerous cases of measles have been confirmed in recent weeks. RELATED STORY: TWO MORE MEASLES CASES IN B.C. BRINGS TOTAL TO 15 Asked for comment, Island Health has confirmed there are currently no lab-confirmed cases of measles anywhere on Vancouver Island. A statement from Island Health said the rumours circulating through social media about the alleged measles case in the Valley are the result of \\u201cheightened awareness and sensitivity as a result of the measles cases on the Lower Mainland.\\u201d The statement said Island Health could not comment on any specific case or patient, regardless if there were any truth to the rumours on social media. \\u201cDue to privacy laws and in support of Island Health\\u2019s confidentiality policies, we cannot discuss or disclose details about individual patients or the care they receive,\\u201d the statement said. \\u201cWhat we can say is that when people are sick, their primary care provider may order a variety of tests to determine the cause of the illness and to rule out other illnesses.\\u201d Fears of catching measles have been rampant across the province after at least 15 cases of measles were diagnosed in Vancouver in recent weeks after an unvaccinated Canadian child contracted the disease on a family trip to Vietnam. Pharmacists across the province are prepared to give booster shots or new vaccinations to adults and children five years or older, according to a statement from the B.C. Pharmacy Association in response to the measles outbreak in Vancouver. The measles, mumps and rubella vaccine is publicly funded and available from pharmacists in nearly every community, the association said. RELATED STORY: VANCOUVER MEASLES OUTBREAK PROMPTS VACCINE VIGILANCE ON ISLAND Cowichan Valley MLA Sonia Furstenau, who is the health critic for the B.C. Green caucus, said she is \\u201cdeeply concerned\\u201d for the people affected by the current measles outbreak in Vancouver and encourages all British Columbians who are medically able to be vaccinated to do so. \\u201cThe BC Green Party believes in evidence-based policy, and the evidence is clear that vaccinations save lives,\\u201d she said. \\u201cThe collective well being that comes from vaccinations is paramount, and we support the health minister\\u2019s efforts in this area. We have a responsibility to protect people who are too young or medically unable to get vaccines from these preventable diseases.\\u201d  robert.barron@cowichanvalleycitizen.com Like us on Facebook and follow us on Twitter      \"\n",

      "   \"content_t\": \"Vancouver Coastal Health (VCH) has confirmed that there is an outbreak of measles in the city.  Dr. Althea Hayden told media late this afternoon there have been a total of eight confirmed cases in the city. There are five lab-confirmed cases at\\u00a0Jules-Verne Secondary School and\\u00a0Anne-Herbert Elementary School. There is a clinical case confirmed at\\u00a0Rose-Des-Vants Elementary School. Hayden says that there are also two \\u201csuspected cases\\u201d she cannot comment on. Cases are occurring in staff, students, and family members of those who attend the schools. Hayden confirmed that the measles was brought into this community through travel outside North America. Hayden says that this outbreak is unrelated to a case involving a gentleman who returned from the Philippines earlier this month. One patient was at BC Children\\u2019s Hospital emergency department while they were infectious and there is a risk of exposure for those who were there at the following times:   Jan. 21 from 10 am to 6:10 pm  Jan. 23 from 4:45 pm\\u00a0 to 11:10 pm  Jan. 24 from 8:13 am to 11:40 am  Feb. 1 from 2 pm to 6:55 pm  Anyone who was at the emergency department during those times and develops symptoms should contact their health care provider immediately. Symptoms of measles: Symptoms of measles include fever, cough, runny nose, and red and inflamed eyes (often sensitive to light), typically starting seven to 14 days after exposure. These are followed three to seven days later by a rash, which starts first on the face and neck, and spreads to the chest, arms and legs, and lasts at least three days. You may also notice spots inside your mouth that look like small grains of sand on a red base.   Check\\u00a0 your immunization records \\u00a0to make sure you and your children have had two doses of the measles vaccine (MMR or MMRV). Your immunization record or your doctor can provide you with this information. Adults 18 years of age and older, born in or after 1970 require two doses of measles vaccine; children 12 months to less than 18 years of age, health care workers and adults attending post-secondary institutions are required to have two doses; those born before 1970 are generally considered immune.  If your immunization record is not up-to-date, contact your local public health unit.  Infants under one year of age, pregnant women and people with weakened immune systems can get very ill with measles and should contact their health care professional immediately for further assessment.  Watch for symptoms of measles until 21 days after exposure. These include a high fever, cold-like symptoms (cough/runny nose); sore eyes or sensitivity to light; small spots with a white centre on the inside of the mouth; and a red rash lasting four to seven days.

NSW Health on Tuesday issued a warning to people who were on Singapore Airlines flight SQ221 from Singapore which arrived in Sydney on January 11.  Two children on the flight were diagnosed with measles on Tuesday. The children caught the train on Friday, January 11 from the International Airport to Meadowbank via Central.  People who may have come into contact with the children have been warned to be alert for symptoms until late January.  \\\"If you develop symptoms please call ahead to your GP so that you do not wait in the waiting room with other patients,\\\" communicable diseases director Dr Vicky Sheppeard said in a statement. The children were on board a Singapore Airlines flight. The warning comes a day after another airport measles scare involving a man who flew into Sydney from Manila on January 11.  The man in his 20s flew from Manila aboard Qantas flight QF20 which landed on Friday at about 6.30am.  He then visited a medical centre in Leichhardt where symptoms were identified and isolation measures put in place.  Vaccination rates for five-year-olds have increased from 88 per cent to 94.6 per cent between 2010 and 2017. (The national target is 95 per cent.)  On Monday, NSW Health said passengers on the Qantas flight and people at Sydney Airport on Friday morning should be alert until late January for symptoms such as fever, sore eyes and a cough. NSW Health on Monday said passengers on the Qantas flight and people at the airport on Friday morning should be alert for measles. It also said people travelling to South-East Asia where measles is prevalent should ensure they are fully vaccinated before setting off.  Symptoms of measles include fever, sore eyes and a cough, followed three or four days later by a red, blotchy rash, NSW Health says.  Six people have been diagnosed with measles in NSW since Christmas.  Symptoms usually occur about 10 to 12 days after infection. The measles-mumps-rubella vaccine is free for people aged one to 52. \"\n",

On Jan. 4, Public Health announced an investigation into one confirmed case with a child between ages 1 and 10. That child brought the measles into the county after traveling into the county from outside the country.Dr. Alan Melnick, director of Public Health, said it\\u2019s highly likely there will be more confirmed cases in the county. Public Health is planning daily updates.\\u201cI wouldn\\u2019t get too hung up on the numbers right now, because they are going to undoubtedly going to change,\\u201d Melnick said.It\\u2019s unclear if the two new cases are connected to the earlier confirmed case. It\\u2019s also unclear if those cases are connected to the 11 suspected cases. Melnick said the first case earlier this month shouldn\\u2019t be contagious anymore.That child, as is true with the two new cases, was unvaccinated. One child is between 1 and 10, and the other is between 11 and 18.The current cases involve children who visited two public locations while contagious. People who visited these locations may be exposed to measles:\\u2022 Church of Truth, 7250 N.E. 41st St., Vancouver, from 11 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. Jan. 6.\\u2022 Portland International Airport, 7000 N.E. Airport Way, Portland, from 10:45 a.m. to 3:45 p.m. on Jan. 7. More specifically, anyone who spent time in Concourse D and the Delta Sky Lounge during that time period.Immunizations are the best protection against measles. One dose of the measles vaccine is about 93 percent effective at prevention, while two doses is about 97 percent effective, according to Public Health.Measles presents the biggest risk to those who have not been vaccinated, including infants younger than 12 months. You are likely immune to measles if you were born before 1957, have had measles before or are up to date on vaccinations (one dose for children 12 months through 3 years old, two doses in anyone 4 years and older).Illness can develop in about one to three weeks after exposure. Symptoms begin with a fever, cough, runny nose, and red eyes, which is followed by a rash that usually begins at the head and spreads over the body.Common complications of measles include ear infection, lung infection and diarrhea. Swelling of the brain is a rare but much more serious complication. Measles may also cause pregnant women to give birth prematurely, or have a low-birth-weight baby. For every 1,000 children with measles, one or two will die from the disease.The last time measles was confirmed in Clark County was in 2011. That year, three measles cases were confirmed. The first case of measles was diagnosed after someone traveled overseas and then returned to Clark County, said Marissa Armstrong, Clark County Public Health information officer. The other two cases were separate from the first, but linked to each other.There was also a measles case in July that Clark County Public Health felt comfortable confirming based off of the evidence of the case. There was, however, no lab test done because the family declined the test. Armstrong said the lack of test confirmation means the state will not conclusively confirm that case. The state and county have different confirmation guidelines.Melnick stressed that measles is a very serious disease, and explained that if everyone would get vaccinated for it, the disease could basically be eradicated. He said he\\u2019s seen people downplay the disease on social media, with an attitude that amounts to \\u201cIt\\u2019s just measles.\\u201d\\u201cIt ain\\u2019t \\u2018just measles,\\u2019 \\u201d Melnick said. \\u201cIt\\u2019s a bad disease.\\u201d\"\n",

A statewide declaration would most likely happen if the outbreak continues to increase in numbers, and reaches other counties, Melnick said.\\u201cIt\\u2019s very possible that we\\u2019ll be seeing cases outside of Clark County, including other spots in Washington as well as to our neighbors to the south,&#8221; Melnick said.The time from when you get exposed to measles to when you develop symptoms and become contagious ranges from seven to 21 days, Melnick said.\\u00a0Melnick said the outbreak is reaching the third or fourth generation now, meaning the outbreak starts with a case that then infects secondary cases, and then those cases infect new people and it starts multiplying and creating new generations.&#8220;We\\u2019re getting into the third and fourth generation and as you can imagine the numbers can increase,&#8221; he told the council. &#8220;I\\u2019m hoping some of the measures we\\u2019ve taken can reduce that. But there\\u2019s a good possibility well be dealing with measles in continuing numbers and perhaps even increasing numbers in the next few weeks and months.\\u201dA statewide emergency means that federal resources can be tapped. Melnick said Clark County Public Health is being stretched somewhat thin by the outbreak. Public Health is having to pull staff from other departments to help assist in the response.Some food inspectors have shifted over in the response effort, which means they&#8217;re not only leaving their main duties, but also leaving a role (food inspection) that collects fees for the county.\\u201cThis basically impacts everything that we do,&#8221; Melnick said. &#8220;But we are faced with this potentially deadly outbreak here and it\\u2019s a matter of prioritizing our resources and it\\u2019s kind of all hands on deck right now.\\u201dCouncil Chair Eileen Quiring discussed with Melnick the reasons for Clark County&#8217;s low vaccination rates, which Melnick said were low for Washington and the U.S.\\u201cIn the 25 years that I\\u2019ve known about immunizations and the controversy over it, there are things on the web and there are organizations that say that vaccinations cause autism and that\\u2019s why some parents are reluctant to have their children vaccinated,\\u201d\\u00a0Quiring said.Quiring explained that sometimes when people say something over and over and over again, others can perceive it as truth, even if it isn&#8217;t.Melnick noted Public Health is not only fighting an outbreak, but also a campaign against false information that appears frequently online.\\u201cUnfortunately there\\u2019s a lot of misinformation going around on social networks and some of it is very sophisticated looking and very well done,&#8221; Melnick said. &#8220;The link between vaccination and autism has been debunked a long time ago. There\\u2019s also misinformation going on about shedding the vaccine virus and causing other people to get infected. That\\u2019s also been debunked, but it\\u2019s very believable. I think that\\u2019s difficult for parents, because they look at this stuff and it seems very legitimate. But it\\u2019s not true. That\\u2019s what we\\u2019re up against.\\u201dMelnick explained the low rates for vaccination mostly stemmed from people requesting personal and philosophical exemptions. He said that religious exemptions are rare, as are health-related exemptions.That&#8217;s been curbed some recently because in the last couple years legislation was passed that required parents to meet with a medical provider to discuss vaccines and personal exemptions. Regardless, Melnick said Clark County&#8217;s vaccination rates are too low.At the 11 schools for which immunization data was available, 678 of 6,958 students were listed as being exempt from receiving their measles, mumps and rubella vaccines during the 2017-2018 school year.According to the Washington State Department of Health, Battle Ground Public School\\u2019s River HomeLink has the highest rate of students who do not have MMR shots. Of the 1,019 students enrolled at the school, 239, or 23.5 percent, are not immunized against the highly contagious virus.Data was not available for Slavic Christian Academy, a private school located in Orchards.Clark County Public Health is requiring exclusion of students and staff without documented immunity to measles from only schools identified as possible exposure sites. Students and staff excluded from those identified schools are also excluded from other schools, child care and other congregate settings.Students and staff at schools where measles exposure did not occur are not impacted by exclusions.Melnick said it would be tragic for a child to die because of the outbreak, and mentioned that if everyone was vaccinated, measles could be eliminated. He also explained that about 400 to 500 people died per year from measles before the vaccine.Council member Julie Olson, who represents District 2, wished that people would take the disease more seriously.\\u201cThis a preventable disease,&#8221; Olson said. &#8220;The idea that it is not dangerous is just wrong. That we allow our children to be exposed to this kind of illness and put them through this kind of suffering is unconscionable.\\u201dThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports that 90 percent of unvaccinated people exposed to the measles virus develop the disease. The virus lives in the nose and throat mucus of an infected person, and can survive for up to two hours in an airspace where the infected person coughed or sneezed.Health officials are urging anyone who has been exposed at an identified location and believes they have symptoms of measles to call their health care provider prior to visiting the medical office to make a plan that avoids exposing others in the waiting room.If you are unsure of your family\\u2019s immunization status, you can view, download and print your family\\u2019s immunization information online at MyIR.net or request a copy of your immunization record from the Washington State Department of Health.Anyone with questions about measles infection or the measles vaccine should call their primary care provider or a county health department:\\u2022\\u00a0Clark County Public Health, 360-397-8021\\u2022\\u00a0Multnomah County Public Health, 503-988-3406\\u2022\\u00a0Washington County Public Health, 503-846-3594\\u2022\\u00a0Clackamas County Public Health, 503-655-8411Public Health has identified additional locations where people may have been exposed to measles. There are dozens of locations in total, including hospitals, Portland International Airport and multiple schools. For a complete list of exposure sites,\\u00a0visit the Public Health measles investigation webpage.Measles symptoms begin with a high fever, cough, runny nose and red eyes, followed by a rash that usually begins at the head and spreads to the rest of the body. A person can spread the virus before they show symptoms. People are contagious with measles for up to four days before and up to four days after the rash appears.\\u00a0After someone is exposed to measles, illness develops in about one to three weeks.\"\n",

Vancouver Coastal Health said the two new cases are not related to the outbreak involving two French language schools. The health authority said the two people were infected while they were travelling, but has only specified that one of them went to the Philippines. A spokesperson with the Ministry of Health confirmed to CTV News the second person had also travelled to the island nation.  VCH said the first measles patient arrived at the YVR on Feb. 11 on Philippine Airlines flight PR 116 from Manila and had a one-night layover. The patient left Vancouver to Edmonton on Air Canada Flight AC236 on Feb. 12. \\\"The safety and security of our passengers, employees and community is our top priority. We recommend anyone who was on the flights or in the terminal at YVR on those days and may be experiencing symptoms to contact 811 to talk to a nurse,\\\" YVR spokesperson Chris Devauld said in an e-mail. The second measles patient is a resident of the Lower Mainland and was infectious when they went to a restaurant and mall in Richmond, according to the health authority. VCH identified several places where people may have been exposed to the highly contagious virus, including: YVR, international arrivals and customs area between 4 and 7 p.m. on Feb. 11 Shuttle bus from YVR to La Quinta Inn in Richmond between 5 to 7 p.m. on Feb. 11 Shuttle bus from YVR to La Quinta Inn in Richmond between 8 and 10:30 a.m. on Feb. 12 YVR, Air Canada domestic departures area between 9 a.m. and noon on Feb. 12 Little Onpin Restaurant in Richmond between 6 and 10 p.m. on Feb. 16 Toys R Us at Lansdowne Centre between 11 a.m. and 9 p.m. on Feb. 17 Toys R Us at Lansdowne Centre between 11 a.m. and 9 p.m. on Feb. 18 'We can do better'  Health officials said those who have never had the measles or did not have the two doses of the vaccine are at the highest risk of contracting the virus. They encourage people to get fully immunized, adding the shot is free for everyone. Health Minister Adrian Dix assures all British Columbians that there is enough vaccine to deal with the demand. \\\"Frankly, people shouldn't be getting measles in the 21st century in British Columbia,\\\" he said. \\\"While our healthcare system is doing very well, I think can we do better and we will do better.\\\" Health Minister Dix says BC is in communications with other provinces and Washington State about the measles outbreak. Says 12 cases is too many and again implores people to get vaccinated @CTVVancouverpic.twitter.com/c1NjsbpeNi Other cases linked to French schools  On Friday, Vancouver Coastal Health announced there was a total of 10 cases that were \\\"very clearly associated\\\" with the schools, Ecole Secondaire Jules-Verne and Ecole Rose-Des-Vents. Officials said 33 students at the two schools have been ordered to stay home because they haven't provided proof of measles vaccination.  The other three cases were contracted while travelling and one unrelated case was acquired locally, according to VCH. Health officials are reminding people they can get vaccinations by visiting their family doctor, a walk-in clinic or urgent primary care centre, or a pharmacy for adults or children over five years old. Calling ahead is also recommended.\"\n",

PROVINCE      Share  Adjust  Comment  Print  The Saskatchewan Health Authority has confirmed a case of measles in Yorkton and is alerting those who may have been exposed to the highly infectious disease.The measles case was confirmed in a returning traveller who had flown into the Regina International Airport on June 9 after overseas travel.The passenger with measles boarded Air China Limited flight CA 0948 departing from Delhi\\u2019s Indira Gandhi International Airport (DEL) at 2:50 a.m. and arrived at Beijing Capital International Airport (PEK) at 11:25 a.m. The passenger was at PEK until boarding Air China Limited flight CA 0991 at 3:25 p.m., which arrived at Vancouver International Airport (YVR) at 10:50 a.m. The SHA issued an exposure alert for people on those flights and anyone in Vancouver\\u2019s main airport terminal at approximately 10:50 a.m., with the path of travel through Canada Customs and Immigration shortly after.The passenger with measles then departed YVR on Air Canada flight AC 8572 at 2 p.m., arriving at Regina International Airport (YQR) at 5 p.m. The SHA is also issuing an exposure alert for those who were at YQR\\u2019s arrivals and baggage area between 5 and 8 p.m.People who were at the Yorkton Regional Health Centre between 8 p.m. June 9 and 3:40 a.m. June 10 may also have been exposed to measles.\\u201cIf you have been on any of these flights or in the airport or in the Yorkton Regional Health Centre during the times above, and are pregnant, immunosuppressed or under the age of one, you may qualify for preventative treatment,\\u201d the SHA said in its alert.\\u201cPassengers, crew, travellers and area residents who may have come into contact with measles as above, and are unsure of their immunization against measles, are asked to contact their local Public Health Office.\\u201dWhile it is expected that the majority of travellers will be immune to measles, which is transmitted by airborne spread, some people may be susceptible, including infants less than one year old, immunosuppressed people or those who have never been immunized against measles.Individuals born after 1970 should have received two doses of a measles vaccine (often given as combined measles, mumps and rubella vaccine, or MMR) to be protected. Those who were born prior to 1970 are likely to be immune due to prior measles infection.Infected individuals are likely to develop symptoms within 7 to 21 days of being exposed. Symptoms of measles include fever, cough, runny nose, red eyes and a rash that starts centrally (including on the face), spreads to the limbs and lasts at leas three days.If you develop any of these symptoms of measles and suspect you may have measles, call ahead to your health care provider, and inform them that you may have been exposed to measles, so that she/he will arrange to see you in a manner that avoids infecting others in the waiting room.If you live in the\\u00a0Yorkton or surrounding area, please call\\u00a01-866-343-1460.If you live in Regina or surrounding area, please call 306-766-7790.In Saskatchewan, for general inquiries regarding measles, please contact HealthLine at 811.If you reside elsewhere, please call your local Public Health Office.

Passengers, crew and travelers who may have come into contact with this case of measles are asked to be aware of this potential exposure should they develop symptoms compatible with measles.Most travellers will be immune to measles due to prior immunization, with older travellers immune from having had measles as a child, according to health officials.Those most likely to develop measles after exposure are infants less than one year old who have not been vaccinated, or others who have never been immunized against measles.If you become ill and suspect you may have measles from this or another exposure such as traveling overseas to the many parts of the world where measles occurs frequently, call your doctor and inform them that you may have measles, so that they can arrange to see you in a manner that avoids infecting others in the waiting room.You can also call your local health unit and ask for the communicable disease nurse.To find a public health unit anywhere in the province, use the locator on ImmunizeBC.caSymptoms of measles include:FeverCough Runny noseRed eyesRash that starts centrally including on the face, spreads to the limbs and lasts at least three daysNon-immune exposed individuals can become infected by being in the same airspace as a measles case. If infected, they will develop symptoms within 7 to 21 days of being exposed.Those who are concerned about their potential measles exposure but have no symptoms can call 8-1-1 and speak to a nurse.Individuals most at risk from measles are those who are completely unvaccinated against the disease including babies under one year of age. Individuals born after 1970 should have received two doses of a measles vaccine (often given as combined measles, mumps and rubella vaccine, or MMR) to be protected.Those who were born prior to 1970 are likely to be immune due to prior measles infection.The BCCDC advises British Columbians to review their immunization status prior to travel. Measles has been on the rise for several years worldwide including several countries in Europe and Southeast Asia, which are common travel destinations for British Columbians.The best time to protect yourself, officials add, is before you travel.\"\n",

THE CANADIAN PRESS/Darryl Dyck   The stakes are high for NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh in a Metro Vancouver byelection race, but an expert says recent Liberal turmoil has been a \\\"gift\\\" to his campaign. The 40-year-old former Ontario legislator has lacked a voice in Parliament since becoming party leader in the fall of 2017. Now he finally has his chance in Burnaby South as voters in the riding cast their ballots on Monday after a six-week race. The Liberals got off to a rocky start when their first candidate, Karen Wang, resigned after pointing out Singh's ethnicity online. In recent weeks, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has been besieged by allegations his office pressured former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould to stop a criminal prosecution of SNC-Lavalin. Singh said he's not taking anything for granted but he's confident his hard work to connect with voters will pay off. \\\"I think people are very disappointed with what's going on with the Liberal government,\\\" he said. \\\"Canadians expect our government works in our interest. It looks more and more like this government and Mr. Trudeau and the Liberal party are working in the interest of a massive multinational corporation.\\\" Trudeau has denied he or his office directed Wilson-Raybould on the matter. Michael Wernick, clerk of the Privy Council, recently said Trudeau repeatedly assured Wilson-Raybould a decision on the prosecution was hers alone to make. Richard T. Lee, the Liberal candidate who replaced Wang in Burnaby South, said few people are raising the issue on the doorstep. \\\"I understand some people are concerned about that, but the office of the prime minister and the prime minister himself have made a statement already,\\\" he said. Byelections typically have low turnouts, but there is evidence the results of them are driven by the popularity of the government and its leader, said Richard Johnston, a University of British Columbia political science professor. \\\"(Singh) may have been handed the gift of some voters as a result of all this,\\\" he said. \\\"Although it's just one thing amongst many, boy, he could use a win right now.\\\" Singh has faced criticism for poor fundraising and low poll numbers. Burnaby South occupies historically strong NDP territory, so if Singh can't win in the riding, it adds to the interpretation that he hasn't secured the support of party loyalists, said Johnston. The NDP beat the Liberals by just over 500 votes in the riding in 2015, but Johnston said he never expected the Liberals to do as well this time in Burnaby South. \\\"That was kind of a high point and their support might drop even further,\\\" he said. Lee said local issues, especially affordable housing, are more important to Burnaby South voters than the situation in Ottawa. He has touted the Liberal government's national housing strategy, which promises $40 billion over 10 years, while Conservative candidate Jay Shin has called for lower taxes and job-creation measures to help residents earn and save more money. Singh has unveiled a plan to build 500,000 affordable homes across Canada. He challenged Trudeau to eliminate the GST for developers building affordable homes, subsidize low-income renters and double the first-time homebuyers' tax credit. Byelections will also take place in York-Simcoe in Ontario and Outremont in Montreal on Monday. The results might provide insight into whether Quebec MP Maxime Bernier's new right-wing People's Party of Canada can snatch votes from the Conservatives. A recent debate in Burnaby South became heated when People's Party candidate Laura-Lynn Tyler Thompson discussed immigration. An online video of the debate shows Singh urging audience members to recognize they are all immigrants, unless they are Indigenous. When Tyler Thompson raises the murder of Burnaby teen Marrisa Shen \\u2014 in which a Syrian national has been charged \\u2014 to argue for more careful vetting of refugees, an audience member yells: \\\"That is racist! Shame on you!\\\" \\\"It's not racist to have safety,\\\" replies Tyler Thompson. Shin, the Conservative candidate, recently distributed flyers taking aim at Tyler Thompson, accusing her of supporting supervised injection sites and the legalization of marijuana, which she described as a \\\"smear campaign\\\" based on \\\"lies.\\\" However, Shin said he isn't worried about Tyler Thompson and doesn't think her message is resonating. \\\"When I speak with voters at the doors, I don't get a sense of that at all,\\\" he said. Tyler Thompson, a former Christian TV show host who opposes abortion and has protested teaching resources that educate kids about gay and transgender identities, said she believes the Conservatives are threatened by the People's Party. \\\"My message is resonating with Canadians because they like my strong stance for family.\\\" \"\n",

As with the previous case, OPH provided no details on age, gender or travel itinerary of the latest patient.\\u00a0OPH said it was working closely with health-care providers and hospitals to contact individuals and families who might have been exposed to the most recently identified infectious case. Updates will be posted at OttawaPublicHealth.ca/Measles .OPH said people who were present at the following locations and times were potentially exposed to the measles virus related to the second case:\\u2022 March 29 2 p.m. \\u2013 6:30 p.m., Loblaws, 100 McArthur Ave\\u2022 March 29 9:15 p.m. \\u2013 9:25 p.m., OC Transpo bus Route 12, Montreal and North River roads to Rideau Street and Sussex Drive.\\u2022 March 29 9:25 p.m. \\u2013 9:50 p.m., OC Transpo bus Route 6, Rideau St. and Sussex Dr. to Heron Rd. and Bank St.\\u2022 March 29 10 p.m. \\u2013 March 30, 2019, 1:30 a.m., O\\u2019Brien\\u2019s Pub and Eatery, 1145 Heron Rd.\\u2022 March 30 4:45 p.m. \\u2013 8 p.m., Coconut Lagoon Restaurant, 853 St. Laurent Blvd.\\u2022 April 1 11 a.m. \\u2013 1:30 p.m., Shoppers Drug Mart and Dynacare Laboratory, 150 Vanier Parkway.\\u2022 April 2\\u00a0 7:30 p.m. \\u2013 April 3, 2019, 7:45 p.m., The Ottawa Hospital General Campus, emergency department\\u2022 April 3 5:45 p.m. \\u2013\\u00a0 April 4, 2019, 5:30 p.m., The Ottawa Hospital General Campus, 7 West.OPH said persons who were at those locations at those times have a higher risk or contracting the disease if were born after 1970 and never received a measles vaccine, have a weakened immune system, or are pregnant and unimmunized and have never had measles.Children under the age of one are also at higher risk. The first vaccine, which is given to children around the age of one, offers 85- to 95-per-cent protection against the infectious disease. The booster vaccine, given to children between the ages of four and six, offers almost 100-per-cent protection.People who believed they were exposed should check their immunization status or call their health-care provider. Anyone who feels ill should isolate themselves and if in need of a medical appointment should call ahead to their provider can take precautions to protect other patients.OPH stressed that people would not go to a hospital to receive the measles vaccine but should instead contact their health-care provider.Doctors have been asked to be on alert for cases of measles in the city this year as outbreaks of measles expand in parts of Canada and around the world. In the U.S., there have been more reported cases of measles in the first three months of 2019 than in all of last year due to falling vaccination rates and vaccine hesitancy.The cases revealed in Ottawa this month are the first in the city since 2016.\\u00a0 \\u00a0         Comments  Share your thoughts           \"\n",

Meanwhile, a passenger with measles has travelled on a flight from Melbourne to Auckland this week, potentially affecting others on board.The person departed Melbourne for Auckland on Jetstar flight JQ217 at 11.45pm on 8 September and arrived in Auckland at 5.20am on 9 September.Public health authorities said anyone who was on the flight should watch out for the symptoms of measles.The disease spreads easily through the air through coughing and sneezing.The Auckland Regional Public Health service said the person did not know they had measles at the time.The number of measles cases in Auckland climbed to 1028 on Friday. Nationwide, there have been 1172 cases.Health officials said the steady and unchanging rate of increase showed the disease has not yet peaked.However, large numbers of people are now being vaccinated - up to 2000 a day.The Auckland Regional Public Health service said it may take a fortnight to see the impact from the increase in vaccinations on the number of measles cases.In Canterbury, an infant has been confirmed as having measles.It is believed the child contracted measles in Auckland before its family returned to Christchurch.The Canterbury District Health Board said the infant had not yet received their first dose of the MMR vaccine, which is usually given at 15 months.The Medical Officer of Health, Alistair Humphrey, said the message from the Ministry of Health was clear - that people should not travel to Auckland if they are not fully vaccinated.\"\n",

'Please vaccinate': Desperate plea from mother as five more measles cases brings total to 20 in Canterbury  Christchurch is running out of the measles vaccine  Ardern's 'strong message to everyone' on Canterbury measles outbreak  The flight left Melbourne at 6:35pm (local time) and arrived in Christchurch at 11:35pm last Tuesday. Anyone who travelled on the flight is now being advised to check their immunisation status with their doctor. Dr Alistair Humphrey, Canterbury Medical Officer of Health, says any passenger or crew member who is not fully protected from measles should quarantine themselves for the next week, even if they have no symptoms. This means staying home from school or work and having no contact with unimmunised people for seven to 14 days after the flight. \\\"They can return to work if they are not unwell on Wednesday 3 April 2019,\\\" he says. People are considered fully protected from measles if they:   Have had two doses of the MMR vaccine  Have had clinically confirmed measles  Were born before 1969  \\\"If you were on this flight and aren't fully immunised against measles, you should also call anyone you have been in the same room with today to let them know that they too have been exposed to measles,\\\" Dr Humphrey says. \\\"This new secondary set of contacts will need to remain isolated for 14 days unless they are fully immunised.\\\" Anyone with these symptoms in the next week should call their doctor:   Respiratory-type illness with dry cough, runny nose, headache  Temperature over 38.5degC, feeling very unwell  A red blotchy rash on day four or five of the illness, usually beginning on the face and moving to chest and arms  People at risk from contracting measles should avoid going to their general practice or hospital except when advised by a healthcare professional or in cases of emergency. Canterbury residents can call their GP after hours and be put in contact with an after-hours nurse, while those outside the region can call Healthline on 0800 611 116. \\\"If your vaccinations are up-to-date, you will have the best protection available,\\\" Dr Humphrey says. \\\"However, please be aware that general practices are currently prioritising people who have never been vaccinated.\\\" Newshub.    \"\n",

While there is no treatment for measles, it can be prevented through immunization.\\u201cIndividuals who were exposed between May 9-17 are no longer eligible for preventative vaccine as the vaccine would not be effective to prevent measles from this exposure,\\u201d the advisory states.They were still encouraged to review their immunization history and arrange vaccination if they have yet to receive two doses of the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine.The potential exposures occurred: May 9 between 3 p.m. and 5:45 p.m. at Sherwood Park Mall May 10, also between 3 p.m. and 5:45 p.m. at Sherwood Park Mall. May 11 at Sherwood Park Mall between 2 p.m. and 4:30 p.m., as well as Smilie\\u2019s Village restaurant in Sherwood Park between 6 and 10 p.m. May 15 at Shoppers Drug Mart, 2020 Sherwood Drive, between 9 p.m. and 11:30 p.m. May 16 between 4 p.m. and 6 p.m. at Carmack\\u2019s Construction in Nisku, as well as the Strathcona County Health Centre emergency department between 8 p.m. May 16 and 5:30 p.m. May 17. May 17 at the University of Alberta Hospital Emergency Department between 4 p.m. and 8 p.m.AHS also said anyone who was in the above locations during the noted timeframes who was born after 1970, has not already had measles and has not received two doses of the vaccine may be at risk for developing the disease.Anyone fitting that description was advised to monitor themselves for symptoms, which include a fever of 38.3 C or higher accompanied by a cough, runny nose and/or red eyes and a red, blotchy rash that appears three to seven days after fever develops. The rash begins to appear behind the ears and on the face before spreading down the body, ending on the arms and legs.Anyone showing those symptoms should stay home and call Health Link at 811 before visiting any health-care facility.People who are pregnant, under one year of age, or have a weakened immune systems were encouraged to contact Health Link as the may be eligible for medication to prevent measles.Children usually receive their first dose of the measles vaccine when they turn one, with a second dose administer between the ages of four and six.Medical officer of health Christopher Sikora is scheduled to hold a media conference on the measles case at 1 p.m. at the University of Alberta Hospital.twitter.com/jonnywakefield        High Level residents under wildfire evacuation alert, Marlboro residents able to...

Vancouver-area measles outbreak: Where you might have been exposed Infectious people were at Costco, the airport, a Blazers game and other sites. Here's what you need to know.The outbreak has started to extend outside the Vancouver area. One man who traveled to Clark County was diagnosed with measles. In Oregon, one case was discovered in Multnomah County . It\\u2019s not yet clear where the person lives.Two people were quarantined during a visit to Hawaii when doctors realized they had been exposed to measles in Clark County and developed the associated rash during the trip.Washington Gov. Jay Inslee declared a state of emergency due to the outbreak on Friday , three days after officials in Clark County declared a public health emergency .The highly contagious virus spreads through the air and can linger for up to two hours in an isolated space. People who have never received a measles vaccine are susceptible to the disease, which can be deadly.State public health officials are urging people who have not received the vaccine to get it now -- as well as people who received the first dose but never the second, both of which are recommended in the first 10 years of life.The measles vaccine is 97 percent effective, and can reduce the risk of infection if gotten within 72 hours after exposure to the virus.Clark County health officials are keeping both students and staff who cannot prove they have been vaccinated from the schools linked to the outbreak, most of which are in the Evergreen School District. Those who are excluded are also not supposed to enter other schools, child care centers or places with lots of people.Even friends and families of students and staff at Evergreen High School and Orchards, Hearthwood and Image elementary schools are asked not to attend any events or games at the schools unless immunized. The Clark County health department has placed this restriction until Jan. 30 for most schools and Feb. 5 for Orchards.To further limit the spread of the virus, health officials ask that people who think they might have measles call their doctor or health care provider before visiting a hospital or doctor\\u2019s office.Washington State Department of Health keeps track of residents\\u2019 immunization status so people can see if they need shots.Clark County Public Health also now maintains a daily call center for questions about the outbreak at 360-397-8021.-- Molly Harbargermharbarger@oregonian.com 503-294-5923 @MollyHarbarger Visit subscription.oregonlive.com/newsletters to get Oregonian/OregonLive journalism delivered to your email inbox.\"\n",

The measles outbreak in Clark County that has racked up 23 confirmed cases since Jan. 1 isn&#8217;t likely to go away or slow down any time soon, even though no new cases or exposure locations were confirmed today.There are seven suspected measles cases, according to a Clark County Public Health news release.Officials are also\\u00a0investigating a suspected case of the measles in King County.\\u00a0Public Health Seattle &amp; King County said Wednesday that the man in his 50s was hospitalized but has been released.\\u00a0Officials say the man had recently traveled to Vancouver, but it\\u2019s not clear if that\\u2019s where he was infected.Officials say results from additional testing to confirm the case are expected by the end of the week.At Wednesday morning&#8217;s Clark County Board of Health meeting, Clark County Public Health Officer Dr. Alan Melnick informed the Clark County Council that the measles outbreak could last months, spread into other Washington counties, south to Oregon and possibly cost Clark County hundreds of thousands of dollars.Melnick said the first several days of the outbreak response effort cost somewhere around $31,000.\\u201cThis is going to be likely, hundreds of thousands of dollars if not more,&#8221; Melnick told the council. &#8220;This is going to be pretty expensive.\\u201dIt&#8217;s even possible the outbreak could be declared a statewide emergency, after being declared a Clark County health emergency by the council last week. A statewide declaration would most likely happen if the outbreak continues to increase in numbers, and reaches other counties, Melnick said.\\u201cIt\\u2019s very possible that we\\u2019ll be seeing cases outside of Clark County, including other spots in Washington as well as to our neighbors to the south,&#8221; Melnick said.The time from when you get exposed to measles to when you develop symptoms and become contagious ranges from seven to 21 days, Melnick said.\\u00a0Melnick said the outbreak is reaching the third or fourth generation now, meaning the outbreak starts with a case that then infects secondary cases, and then those cases infect new people and it starts multiplying and creating new generations.&#8220;We\\u2019re getting into the third and fourth generation and as you can imagine the numbers can increase,&#8221; he told the council. &#8220;I\\u2019m hoping some of the measures we\\u2019ve taken can reduce that. But there\\u2019s a good possibility well be dealing with measles in continuing numbers and perhaps even increasing numbers in the next few weeks and months.\\u201dA statewide emergency means that federal resources can be tapped. Melnick said Clark County Public Health is being stretched somewhat thin by the outbreak. Public Health is having to pull staff from other departments to help assist in the response.Some food inspectors have shifted over in the response effort, which means they&#8217;re not only leaving their main duties, but also leaving a role (food inspection) that collects fees for the county.\\u201cThis basically impacts everything that we do,&#8221; Melnick said. &#8220;But we are faced with this potentially deadly outbreak here and it\\u2019s a matter of prioritizing our resources and it\\u2019s kind of all hands on deck right now.\\u201dCouncil Chair Eileen Quiring discussed with Melnick the reasons for Clark County&#8217;s low vaccination rates, which Melnick said were low for Washington and the U.S.\\u201cIn the 25 years that I\\u2019ve known about immunizations and the controversy over it, there are things on the web and there are organizations that say that vaccinations cause autism and that\\u2019s why some parents are reluctant to have their children vaccinated,\\u201d\\u00a0Quiring said.Quiring explained that sometimes when people say something over and over and over again, others can perceive it as truth, even if it isn&#8217;t.Melnick noted Public Health is not only fighting an outbreak, but also a campaign against false information that appears frequently online.\\u201cUnfortunately there\\u2019s a lot of misinformation going around on social networks and some of it is very sophisticated looking and very well done,&#8221; Melnick said. &#8220;The link between vaccination and autism has been debunked a long time ago. There\\u2019s also misinformation going on about shedding the vaccine virus and causing other people to get infected. That\\u2019s also been debunked, but it\\u2019s very believable. I think that\\u2019s difficult for parents, because they look at this stuff and it seems very legitimate. But it\\u2019s not true. That\\u2019s what we\\u2019re up against.\\u201dMelnick explained the low rates for vaccination mostly stemmed from people requesting personal and philosophical exemptions. He said that religious exemptions are rare, as are health-related exemptions.That&#8217;s been curbed some recently because in the last couple years legislation was passed that required parents to meet with a medical provider to discuss vaccines and personal exemptions. Regardless, Melnick said Clark County&#8217;s vaccination rates are too low.At the 11 schools for which immunization data was available, 678 of 6,958 students were listed as being exempt from receiving their measles, mumps and rubella vaccines during the 2017-2018 school year.According to the Washington State Department of Health, Battle Ground Public School\\u2019s River HomeLink has the highest rate of students who do not have MMR shots. Of the 1,019 students enrolled at the school, 239, or 23.5 percent, are not immunized against the highly contagious virus.Data was not available for Slavic Christian Academy, a private school located in Orchards.Clark County Public Health is requiring exclusion of students and staff without documented immunity to measles from only schools identified as possible exposure sites. Students and staff excluded from those identified schools are also excluded from other schools, child care and other congregate settings.Students and staff at schools where measles exposure did not occur are not impacted by exclusions.Melnick said it would be tragic for a child to die because of the outbreak, and mentioned that if everyone was vaccinated, measles could be eliminated. He also explained that about 400 to 500 people died per year from measles before the vaccine.Council member Julie Olson, who represents District 2, wished that people would take the disease more seriously.\\u201cThis a preventable disease,&#8221; Olson said. &#8220;The idea that it is not dangerous is just wrong. That we allow our children to be exposed to this kind of illness and put them through this kind of suffering is unconscionable.\\u201dThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports that 90 percent of unvaccinated people exposed to the measles virus develop the disease. The virus lives in the nose and throat mucus of an infected person, and can survive for up to two hours in an airspace where the infected person coughed or sneezed.Health officials are urging anyone who has been exposed at an identified location and believes they have symptoms of measles to call their health care provider prior to visiting the medical office to make a plan that avoids exposing others in the waiting room.If you are unsure of your family\\u2019s immunization status, you can view, download and print your family\\u2019s immunization information online at MyIR.net or request a copy of your immunization record from the Washington State Department of Health.Anyone with questions about measles infection or the measles vaccine should call their primary care provider or a county health department:\\u2022\\u00a0Clark County Public Health, 360-397-8021\\u2022\\u00a0Multnomah County Public Health, 503-988-3406\\u2022\\u00a0Washington County Public Health, 503-846-3594\\u2022\\u00a0Clackamas County Public Health, 503-655-8411Public Health has identified additional locations where people may have been exposed to measles. There are dozens of locations in total, including hospitals, Portland International Airport and multiple schools. For a complete list of exposure sites,\\u00a0visit the Public Health measles investigation webpage.Measles symptoms begin with a high fever, cough, runny nose and red eyes, followed by a rash that usually begins at the head and spreads to the rest of the body. A person can spread the virus before they show symptoms. People are contagious with measles for up to four days before and up to four days after the rash appears.\\u00a0After someone is exposed to measles, illness develops in about one to three weeks.\"\n",
